# AGRe

Considering various opinions (gossips, reviews, surveys, multilingual comments extracted from social Web applications or provided by other sources) – already available from previous academic years –, plus anonymous statistics about the given marks for a discipline, provide a service-oriented or serverless Web platform able to [recommend](https://github.com/YuyangZhangFTD/awesome-RecSys-papers) to a student significant information concerning useful learning resources (books, on-line documentations, software tools, existing projects, public code repositories, and others), important persons (e.g., colleagues, tutors) to be contacted, good/bad points regarding the personal knowledge on the taught topics, optimal hours of study, etc. The data access will be also provided by a SPARQL endpoint, in formats such as HTML + RDFa and JSON-LD including [Course Instance](http://schema.org/CourseInstance) and [Creative Work](http://schema.org/CreativeWork) constructs. Consult a list of [recommendations APIs](https://www.programmableweb.com/category/recommendations/apis?category=20358). Bonus: the use of [natural user interactions](https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~busaco/teach/courses/hci/hci-film.html#week13) – for example, a [conversational user interface](http://designforhumanity.danieleckler.com/) provided by the [UI bots](https://thereisabotforthat.com/).
