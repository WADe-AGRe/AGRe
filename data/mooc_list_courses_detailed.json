The way we are genetically composed, creates identifiable traits that can uniquely represent us as individuals. Just as DNA can be used to identify individuals except for identical twins, some biometric traits such as fingerprints and iris prints are distinctive even among identical twins.\nCurrent antiquated mechanisms such as keys, passes, tokens, passwords, PIN\u2019s and secret questions are easily stolen and shared however biometrics is the method of identifying a person based on their distinctive physiological or behavioural characteristics and these attributes cannot be shared, misplaced or forgotten. Into the future, it is becoming increasingly important to have confidence in secure authentication of electronically stored information. As once our identity has been exploited, it could be used by an unauthorised person for fraudulent activities.The course requires 3 \u2013 4 hours of study each week and is self-paced over four-weeks. It provides video lectures with interactive Zaption activities, interactive PDF\u2019s and weekly discussion forums.

This course is designed to prepare online instructors who teach college and university courses to be able to increase instructor, social, and cognitive presence in their online courses. Each of the weekly modules contains annotated research related to the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework, grounding the application-based activities in theory.\nEngagement in this networked community of practice is designed to stimulate the process of inquiry and collaboration among educators. Participants will explore emerging technologies and create digital assets that they can employ in their own instruction.In an effort to ensure that the course would be pedagogically beneficial for faculty who teach online, the pedagogical competencies for online teaching success defined by Penn State were reviewed. The Humanizing Online Instruction MOOC addresses nine of the 27 competencies. The competencies that are aligned with this course include (1) attend to the unique challenges of distance learning where learners are separated by time and geographic proximity and interactions are primarily asynchronous in nature, (2) provide detailed feedback on assignments and exams, (3) communicate with students about course progress and changes, (4) promote and encourage a learning environment that is safe and inviting and mutually respectful, (5) monitor and manage student progress, (6) communicate course goals and outcomes, (7) provide evidence to students of their presence in the course on a regular basis, (8) effectively use course communication systems, and (9) communicate expectations of student course behavior (Ragan, Bigatel, Kennan, & Dillon, 2012). The course objectives were carefully crafted to align with these competencies.\nCourse Objectives:1. Evaluate the use of several asynchronous tools that enhance teaching presence, social presence, and cognitive presence to meet the needs of learners who choose distance learning for the sake of convenience.2. Evaluate and choose the audio/video screencasting tool that will be used for providing learners feedback via video.3. Develop a sample course announcement using audio and/or video to include in a comprehensive course communication plan.4. Demonstrate good digital citizenship using instructor presence.5. Explore and select a new method of monitoring and managing student progress using voice and video.6. Develop course goals and outcomes communications.7. Develop a personal action plan explaining the new communication strategies to enhance instructor, cognitive, and social presence that will be included in the learners\u2019 future courses.8.

These representations sit at the intersection of statistics and computer science, relying on concepts from probability theory, graph algorithms, machine learning, and more. They are the basis for the state-of-the-art methods in a wide variety of applications, such as medical diagnosis, image understanding, speech recognition, natural language processing, and many, many more. They are also a foundational tool in formulating many machine learning problems.\nThis course is the third in a sequence of three. Following the first course, which focused on representation, and the second, which focused on inference, this course addresses the question of learning: how a PGM can be learned from a data set of examples. The course discusses the key problems of parameter estimation in both directed and undirected models, as well as the structure learning task for directed models. The (highly recommended) honors track contains two hands-on programming assignments, in which key routines of two commonly used learning algorithms are implemented and applied to a real-world problem.\nCourse 3 of 3 in the Probabilistic Graphical Models Specialization.\nWEEK 1Learning: OverviewThis module presents some of the learning tasks for probabilistic graphical models that we will tackle in this course.Review of Machine Learning Concepts from Prof. Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Class (Optional)This module contains some basic concepts from the general framework of machine learning, taken from Professor Andrew Ng's Stanford class offered on Coursera. Many of these concepts are highly relevant to the problems we'll tackle in this course.Parameter Estimation in Bayesian NetworksThis module discusses the simples and most basic of the learning problems in probabilistic graphical models: that of parameter estimation in a Bayesian network. We discuss maximum likelihood estimation, and the issues with it. We then discuss Bayesian estimation and how it can ameliorate these problems.Graded: Learning in Parametric ModelsGraded: Bayesian Priors for BNs\nWEEK 2Learning Undirected ModelsIn this module, we discuss the parameter estimation problem for Markov networks - undirected graphical models.

Uno de los paradigmas m\u00e1s conocidos y usados en la actualidad es el paradigma orientado a objetos, el cual est\u00e1 fundamentado en pilares como la abstracci\u00f3n, el encapsulamiento, la modularidad, el polimorfismo y la herencia. En este m\u00f3dulo tendr\u00e1 la oportunidad de conocer los conceptos b\u00e1sicos de este paradigma: clases, objetos, asociaciones y m\u00e9todos. Tenga en cuenta que el tiempo estimado para la realizaci\u00f3n de todas las actividades de este m\u00f3dulo es de cerca de 14 horas, tiempo que usted puede invertir de acuerdo con sus posibilidades.

La construcci\u00f3n del modelo conceptual del mundo del problema en muchas ocasiones implica usar el concepto de colecci\u00f3n o grupos de elementos de la misma clase, y manejar estrategias para a\u00f1adir nuevos elementos a ese grupo o para buscar un elemento en particular dentro de dicha colecci\u00f3n. En este m\u00f3dulo vamos a tratar algunos conceptos fundamentales de la programaci\u00f3n que nos permiten manejar grupos de elementos: los arreglos y las matrices, que son estructuras contenedoras de 1 y 2 dimensiones. Usaremos estas entidades para representar colecciones de datos u objetos en nuestro modelo del mundo. Adem\u00e1s, vamos a revisar las diferentes operaciones algor\u00edtmicas que podemos realizar sobre las estructuras de datos en 1 y 2 dimensiones, ya sea para agregar y eliminar elementos o para realizar tanto b\u00fasquedas como manipulaciones de los objetos contenidos all\u00ed. Tenga en cuenta que el tiempo estimado para la realizaci\u00f3n de todas las actividades de este m\u00f3dulo es de cerca de 16 horas, tiempo que usted puede invertir de acuerdo con sus posibilidades.

Uno de los problemas cr\u00edticos que enfrentan los programadores es la eficiencia de los programas que escriben. Un usuario en general espera que el programa sea capaz de contestar sus requerimientos r\u00e1pidamente. \u00bfC\u00f3mo construir entonces programas que sean eficientes? La respuesta a esta pregunta es bastante m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil de contestar, puesto que intervienen muchos factores diferentes. Uno de los enfoques de esta situaci\u00f3n es el problema de la b\u00fasqueda eficiente de informaci\u00f3n en un grupo de valores, puesto que dicha actividad es fundamental en muchos programas y una buena cantidad del tiempo de ejecuci\u00f3n se va en localizar algo que el usuario quiere consultar. Dado este contexto, resulta muy conveniente ordenar la informaci\u00f3n que maneja el programa (objetos o valores simples) para que sea f\u00e1cil de encontrar. El tema de b\u00fasqueda en particular ser\u00e1 el que abordaremos en este m\u00f3dulo. Tenga en cuenta que el tiempo estimado para la realizaci\u00f3n de todas las actividades de este m\u00f3dulo es de cerca de 11 horas, tiempo que usted puede invertir de acuerdo con sus posibilidades. Le recomendamos que desarrolle todas las actividades en el orden propuesto y que considere hacerlo en un tiempo de dos semanas.Graded: Reto 1 Nivel b\u00e1sicoGraded: Evaluaci\u00f3n te\u00f3rica - OrdenamientoGraded: Evaluaci\u00f3n Pr\u00e1ctica - Exposici\u00f3n canina\nWEEK 4M\u00f3dulo 4: Herencia\u00a1Le damos la bienvenida al m\u00f3dulo 4! Es un hecho que los programas de computador que se construyen deben evolucionar a medida que el problema y el contexto en el que \u00e9ste ocurre cambian. Un programa de buena calidad es aquel que adem\u00e1s de resolver el problema actual que se plantea, tiene una estructura que le permite evolucionar a costo razonable. No nos interesa construir un programa que tengamos que rehacer cada vez que alg\u00fan aspecto del problema cambie o un nuevo requerimiento aparezca. Adem\u00e1s de hacer evolucionar los programas a bajo costo, nos enfrentamos siempre al reto de hacer las implementaciones de la manera lo m\u00e1s eficiente posible (en tiempo e inversi\u00f3n). Para esto, lo ideal ser\u00eda aprovechar otros desarrollos previos que nos ayuden en la construcci\u00f3n de nuestro programa. Esta es la idea del mecanismo de reutilizaci\u00f3n de clases denominado herencia, tema de este m\u00f3dulo. Imag\u00ednese los elevados costos si cada vez que nos lanzamos a construir un nuevo programa debemos partir desde cero. En este m\u00f3dulo vamos a enfrentarnos al problema de hacer implementaciones eficientes de programas: vamos a utilizar el mecanismo de herencia que nos permitir\u00e1 reutilizar c\u00f3digo de clases que ya implementamos para acelerar el tiempo que toma programar nuevas clases. A trav\u00e9s del m\u00f3dulo nos familiarizaremos con los conceptos de superclases y subclases, entenderemos c\u00f3mo a trav\u00e9s de la visibilidad de los atributos y m\u00e9todos podremos tener mayor o menor versatilidad al momento de implementar nuevas clases usando herencia. Tambi\u00e9n explicaremos qu\u00e9 es una clase abstracta y sus implicaciones en el mundo del problema. Tenga en cuenta que el tiempo estimado para la realizaci\u00f3n de todas las actividades de este m\u00f3dulo es de cerca de 15 horas, tiempo que usted puede invertir de acuerdo con sus posibilidades.

A diferencia de los m\u00f3dulos anteriores, en este m\u00f3dulo del curso, vamos a cambiar de metodolog\u00eda de trabajo, ya que para construir una interfaz gr\u00e1fica no se necesitan grandes habilidades algor\u00edtmicas. Se trata sobre todo de entender c\u00f3mo utilizar algunas clases de Java que nos permiten crear los elementos gr\u00e1ficos y de interacci\u00f3n, c\u00f3mo conectarlos entre s\u00ed y c\u00f3mo conectarlos con el mundo del programa. Vamos a trabajar de la siguiente manera: primero revisaremos los conceptos te\u00f3ricos b\u00e1sicos necesarios para ir creando poco a poco los elementos que componen la interfaz gr\u00e1fica, estos son: la ventana principal, los p\u00e1neles, las etiquetas, las cajas de textos y los botones. Segundo, veremos c\u00f3mo repartir las responsabilidades entre la interfaz gr\u00e1fica y el mundo y c\u00f3mo conectarlos entre s\u00ed. Y por \u00faltimo, veremos c\u00f3mo se maneja la interacci\u00f3n con el usuario. Despu\u00e9s de cada presentaci\u00f3n te\u00f3rica, usted desarrollar\u00e1 un ejercicio para poner en pr\u00e1ctica los nuevos conocimientos y enfrentarse al reto de hacerlo usted mismo con la ayuda de una gu\u00eda de trabajo. El punto de partida de los retos de este m\u00f3dulo es el mundo de la aplicaci\u00f3n. Su misi\u00f3n es construir la interfaz gr\u00e1fica de forma incremental, \u00a1reto tras reto! Tenga en cuenta que el tiempo estimado para la realizaci\u00f3n de todas las actividades de este m\u00f3dulo es de cerca de 9 horas, tiempo que usted puede invertir de acuerdo con sus posibilidades.

We present their histories, their philosophical underpinnings, their transformations in the modern global world, and we give you a chance to reflect upon meditation practices through secular contemplations designed just for this course.\nWe use a traditional, if overly simplistic, way of grouping Buddhist philosophical systems and ritual-contemplative practices into \u201cthree vehicles\u201d, three programs of theory and practice supporting the personal journey from suffering to enlightenment. This scheme became normative in India and Tibet: (i) the Lesser Vehicle (H\u012bnay\u0101na), (ii) the Great Vehicle (Mah\u0101y\u0101na), and (iii) the Adamantine Vehicle (Vajray\u0101na), also referred to as \u201cesoteric Buddhism\u201d or \u201cBuddhist tantra\u201d. To this, we will add a fourth Vehicle which is explicit in many Tibetan materials, though no standard term ever emerged that was accepted by all sectarian traditions - we will thus term it as the \u201cNatural Vehicle\u201d or \u201cPost Tantra\u201d. We follow an indigenous Tibetan tradition in terms of characterizing each with a specific orientational paradigm - repression, refinement, transformation, and natural freedom. These twelve meditative traditions constitute the framework for the course\u2019s discussion of the main streams of Tibetan Buddhist meditation.The five modules of the present course, dedicated to \"Lesser Vehicle\" practices and perspectives, treat the first five of these twelve types. Each module in turn has four components: (i) the specific Buddhist meditation in its traditional presentation and practice; (ii) modern scientific research into its efficacy and dynamics, or on practices, principles, and processes related to this type of meditation in our analysis; (iii) the fact, problems, and opportunities of modern secular adaptations in a variety of educational, professional, and personal settings; and (iv) secular practices for experimentation, which are either direct adaptations or new practices designed to give an experiential sense of some of the principles underlying the Buddhist meditative practice.\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Coursera", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/coursera"}, "university": {"text": "University of Virginia", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/university-virginia"}, "instructors": [{"text": "David Francis Germano", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/david-francis-germano"}, {"text": "Kurtis R.

Developing these models and gaining insights from data do not necessarily lead to successful implementations. This depends on the ability to communicate results to those who make decisions.\nPresenting findings to decision makers who are not familiar with the language of analytics presents a challenge. In this course you will learn how to communicate analytics results to stakeholders who do not understand the details of analytics but want evidence of analysis and data. You will be able to choose the right vehicles to present quantitative information, including those based on principles of data visualization. You will also learn how to develop and deliver data-analytics stories that provide context, insight, and interpretation.\nCourse 4 of 5 in the Data Analytics for Business Bootcamp Specialization.\nWEEK 1Introduction to the CourseIn this module we\u2019ll briefly review the Information-Action Value Chain we introduced in Course 1. Then we\u2019ll see how analytical techniques are applied in business problems, first by looking at some \u201cclassic\u201d business problems that have been around for a long time, then by looking at some \u201cemergent\u201d business problems that have resulted from more recent advances in technology.Graded: Week 1 Quiz\nWEEK 2Best Practices in Data VisualizationIn this module we\u2019ll learn about a variety of visualizations used to illustrate and communicate data. We will start with the different vehicles used to present quantitative information. We will then look at a set of examples of data visualizations and discuss what makes them effective or ineffective. Finally, we discuss Excel charts and why most of them should be avoided. After completing this module, you will be able to better understand the characteristics of good data visualization and avoid common mistakes when creating your own graphs.Graded: Week 2 Quiz\nWEEK 3Interpreting, Telling, and SellingIn this module we\u2019ll cover a number of topics around interpreting data, gathering additional data, and pitching our recommendations based on our analysis. First, we\u2019ll discuss ways in which we misinterpret or misrepresent data and how to avoid them, such as mistaking correlation with causation, allowing cognitive biases to influence how we see data, and visualizing data in misleading ways. We\u2019ll also learn how experimentation can help us obtain more data, including compromises we may need to make in measurement. Finally, we\u2019ll discuss how we communicate our results and recommendations, with a focus on knowing our audience, telling compelling stories, and creating clear and effective communication materials.Graded: Week 3 Quiz\nWEEK 4Acting on DataIn our final module we\u2019ll walk through two case studies and illustrate the ideas we\u2019ve covered in the course and in the specialization as a whole. The first case shows how experimentation can be used to create data, sometimes with surprising results. The second case presents a comprehensive analysis that illustrates the entire analytic lifecycle, and shows how different methods and both quantitative and qualitative analysis can be brought together to solve one strategically important analytical problem.Graded: Week 4 QuizGraded: Final Course Assignment\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Coursera", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/coursera"}, "university": {"text": "University of Colorado Boulder", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/university-colorado-boulder"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Dan Zhang", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/dan-zhang"}, {"text": "David Torgerson", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/david-torgerson"}, {"text": "Manuel Laguna", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/manuel-laguna"}], "category": {"text": "Data Science", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/data-science"}, "country": {"text": "USA", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/usa"}, "duration": {"text": "4 Weeks", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/4-weeks"}, "frequency": {"text": "No information", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/no-information"}, "exam": {"text": "No Exam and/or Final Project information", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/no-exam-andor-final-project-information"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Verified Certificate (Paid)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-verified-certificate-paid"}, "language": {"text": "English", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/english"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/power-macroeconomics-economic-principles-real-world-coursera", "title": "The Power of Macroeconomics: Economic Principles in the Real World (Coursera)", "description": "STARTS\nIn this course, you will learn all of the major principles of macroeconomics normally taught in a quarter or semester course to college undergraduates or MBA students.

It starts by talking about energy itself and where it comes from. This includes how much we have, who has it, who uses it, and what that all means.\n The video clips are produced in a fast-paced multimedia format during which Professor Ruzic throws in fun and demonstrations. There are multiple-choice questions to check your understanding and some more in-depth exercises to guide you deeper into the subject.After explaining the main things we use energy for \u2013 our cars and electronics! \u2013 fossil fuels are examined in detail. Want to really learn about fracking or pipelines? Watch these segments. The environmental effects of fossil fuels are taught as well. Global warming, acid rain, and geoengineering all are in this part of the course. Part of their solution is too. Renewables follow, with clips on solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, biofuels, etc. You\u2019ll even see Professor Ruzic in a corn field and in the middle of a stream showing how you could dam it up.Finally, nuclear power is taught in detail \u2013 how it really works and what happens when it doesn\u2019t work, as in Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima, as well as how we are making it today, which is shown here without political preconceptions. In this course, economics takes center stage. People will ultimately do whatever costs the least, so energy policy is most effective when it is targeted at the user\u2019s wallet.Throughout the course there are 24 segments on \u201cHow Things Work.\" These guides to everyday life are tremendously varied, covering everything from fireworks to making beer to what happens backstage at a theater. The course is designed to be enjoyable as well as informative. We hope you will take a look!\nWEEK 1Course OrientationYou will become familiar with the course, your classmates, and our learning environment. The orientation will also help you obtain the technical skills required for the course.Week 1: How It All Starts and EndsThe course starts by looking at the basic principles of energy sources at the level of the atoms and molecules. This shows how everything from wind energy to nuclear energy share the same basic concept. We then go on to blow some stuff up and explain the statistics of what forms of energy are used around the world \u2013 who has them, who uses them, and who produces them. \u201cHow Things Work\u201d segments start with a bang (fireworks) and then get both louder (bell towers) and softer (silencers).Graded: Week 1 QuizGraded: Compare Chemical and Nuclear Energy\nWEEK 2Week 2: Getting and Using the PowerHere we dig into the two most frequent uses of energy and how to make it into useful devices, namely, the engines in cars and making electricity. How exactly does an engine work, and are there ways to make them better? How do they tie into the basic physics from the first week? We also find out what is so \u201csmart\u201d about the electric grid and how it is changing over time. \u201cHow Things Work\u201d features airports, hybrid cars, and really flashy electricity (i.e., lightning!).Graded: Week 2 QuizGraded: How Much of a \u201cHorse\u201d Are You?\nWEEK 3Week 3: Why Coal Is DirtyFossil fuels still dominate the energy landscape, and this week we go into them deeply, starting with coal. What is it? Where does it come from? Who has it? Who uses it? What problems does it cause? We will explore global warming and, more importantly, what can be done about it. You get to control the world in a climate model and see how bad (or how good) the future can be. \u201cHow Things Work\u201d takes you into a coal power plant, a trash transfer station, and a waste treatment plant, so grab your shovels and hard hat, and let\u2019s dig in!Graded: Week 3 QuizGraded: The Climate \u201cGame\u201d\nWEEK 4Week 4: Oil and Gas \u2013 With Us Forever?Oil and natural gas are the most used and most popular energy sources in the world. What are they? Where do they come from? Who uses, needs, and makes them? All the facts and the controversies over pipelines and hydraulic fracturing (fracking) are discussed in detail. All of this is tightly tied to economics so grab your wallets \u2013 you will really see where your money goes! \"How Things Work\u201d takes us to high places \u2013 an observatory, a cell phone tower, and a laser light show!Graded: Week 4 QuizGraded: Pipelines and Fracking\nWEEK 5Week 5: Renewables \u2013 What Is New under the SunRenewable energy sources finally make an appearance this week. Here we will tell you about everything powered by the sun directly and indirectly. This includes photo-voltaic, passive solar design, wind, and biofuels. Again, their inner working, what is needed, and how much it costs are the focus. You will see Prof. Ruzic make moonshine and show you how you can, too. \u201cHow Things Work\u201d takes you to an actual windmill and brewery, and, just for fun, an ice skating rink.Graded: Week 5 QuizGraded: Solar Experiments\nWEEK 6Week 6: More Renewables and Your Radioactive WorldWe finish up renewables this week by discussing those coming from water \u2013 hydropower, geothermal, waves, and tides. You will even see Prof. Ruzic walking on water. Then, the world of the nucleus is opened up to you. What is radioactivity and how much should be feared? What is the basis for fission and how does a power plant differ from an atomic bomb? \u201cHow Things Work\u201d looks at the visual world \u2013 from why the sky is blue to how a 3D IMAX movie system makes it seem like you are really there.Graded: Week 6 QuizGraded: Home Improvement\nWEEK 7Week 7: Nuclear Power Problems and SolutionsThis week covers the heart of nuclear power. We will follow the fuel from the ground and into the reactors. We also cover the major accidents in the history of nuclear power in detail. Do you remember Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and/or Fukushima? Do you want to understand in detail what worked and what did not, how much is costs, and if it is all worthwhile? Then be sure to watch the videos this week. \u201cHow Things Work\u201d takes a lighter view \u2013 we visit a football stadium, go backstage at a theater, and even peer into the mind by exploring brain-scanning MRIs.Graded: Week 7 QuizGraded: It Can Not Happen Here\nWEEK 8Week 8: Our Future Is Bright!What does the future hold? We\u2019ll start with how to hold the spent nuclear fuel and then talk about the modern \u201cthird generation\u201d reactors being built today that have safety systems requiring no mechanical or human intervention. This leads to reactors that can make more fuel than they use and also to nuclear fusion \u2013 the energy source of the sun. \u201cHow Things Work\u201d explores cooking/grilling, how microwave ovens work, and super computers, taking you to arguably the largest and fastest computer in the world.Graded: Week 8 QuizGraded: The Nuclear Option\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Coursera", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/coursera"}, "university": {"text": "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/university-illinois-urbana-champaign"}, "instructors": [{"text": "David N.

The course focuses on key knowledge areas of sustainability theory and practice, including population, ecosystems, global change, energy, agriculture, water, environmental economics and policy, ethics, and cultural history.\nThis subject is of vital importance, seeking as it does to uncover the principles of the long-term welfare of all the peoples of the planet. As sustainability is a cross-disciplinary field of study, this foundation requires intellectual breadth: as I describe it in the class text, understanding our motivations requires the humanities, measuring the challenges of sustainability requires knowledge of the sciences (both natural and social), and building solutions requires technical insight into systems (such as provided by engineering, planning, and management).\nWEEK 1Orientation and IntroductionIn this module, you will become familiar with the course, your classmates, and the learning environment.

What is strategic planning and what can boards do to carry this out effectively?Week 2: This week's questions: What is the board's role in assessing the performance of the organization? Why is performance assessment important? Why do many boards have difficulty meeting their performance assessment responsibilities?Week 3: This week's questions: What are the elements of the fundraising/resource development process? What is the board's role in ensuring the organization has adequate funding? What information should be in a resource development plan?Week 4: At this stage, you are asked to review the course content, submit a written assignment (known lightheartedly as a BEAR (Board Effectiveness Readiness Assessment), and take two multiple choice Readiness Assurance Tests (known similarly as RATs). One RAT will assess knowledge and reading comprehension and the other will test application of knowledge within a practical case.Week 5: We will encourage you to discuss the RATs in the discussion forums and take them again should you wish to change any of your answers based on the information exchanged.\nThe Roles and Responsibilities of Nonprofit Boards of Directors within the Governance Process is course 2 of 4 in the Improving Leadership & Governance in Nonprofit Organisations Specialisation.Identify and analyze leadership and governance issues, create practical ways to improve board performance and work with boards to implement these improvements. This Specialization consists of three courses plus a Capstone Project: (1) Course 1 topics: The unique nature of the nonprofit sector in society; leadership in nonprofit organizations and the governance process. (2) Course 2 topics: The roles and responsibilities of nonprofit organization boards of directors and the challenges in carrying them out effectively.

Do you need to review English grammar? Have you forgotten the grammar you once studied? If so, this course is perfect for you. The first course in this specialization is a refresher on some tools needed for good writing.\nIt will help prepare you for the other courses. You will need about 10 hours to complete this first course. Writing is a skill and to learn a skill well, you need to practice. In this course, you will watch short video lectures and then practice and discuss what you have learned. Make sure you take good notes and use the peer discussions to ask questions. Then you'll be able to remember the rules you learn in this course when you start writing essays in the next course.After completing this course, you will be able to: - identify the correct verb tenses to use- use commas effectively - utilize several different sentence types- write more effectively in EnglishPlease note that the free version of this class gives you access to all of the instructional videos and handouts. The peer feedback and quizzes are only available in the paid version.\nCourse 1 of 5 in the Academic English: Writing Specialization.\nWEEK 1Course IntroductionThis is the first course in the Academic English: Writing specialization, which will help prepare you for studying in an American college or university. This first course will go over some of the basics of grammar and punctuation that you'll need to do good writing. It is not intended to review all aspects of English grammar, only the few topics chosen for this class. In this short module, to get started, introduce yourself and get to know the other learners a little bit. In the following lessons, you will watch video lectures, do readings, do practice exercises, and take quizzes. To pass the course, just pass all three quizzes. When you finish one activity, then go on to the next one. Enjoy the class!\nWEEK 2Verb Tenses and ConjunctionsIn this module, you will watch video lectures, do readings, do practice exercises, and take quizzes. You can re-watch the videos or redo the exercises as many times as you need to to help you understand the material. This module will help you review verb tenses and how to use them correctly. You probably already studied these in your other English classes, so this will just be a quick reminder. Then you'll begin learning about how to use conjunctions in your sentences. This will help you write different kinds of sentences and make your writing more interesting.Graded: Verb Tenses and Conjunctions\nWEEK 3Compound and Complex SentencesNow that you've learned about conjunctions, you're ready to learn about different types of sentences. In English, there are four types of sentences that you can use--and should use--to make your writing more interesting to read. In this module, you'll learn about two of the advanced sentence types.Graded: Compound and Complex Sentences\nWEEK 4More Commas, Parallel Structure, and Sentence VarietyIn this module, you'll learn some other uses for commas. After studying this module, you'll know about 95% of the ways commas can be used. That means you'll be able to write confidently, knowing that you are using commas correctly and not just guessing. In addition to learning about commas, you'll learn about creating parallel structure and sentence variety. When you add these to your writing tools, your writing will be even more effective.Graded: Commas, Parallel Structure, and Sentence Variety\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Coursera", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/coursera"}, "university": {"text": "University of California, Irvine", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/university-california-irvine"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Tamy Chapman", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/tamy-chapman"}], "category": {"text": "Languages & Literature", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/languages-literature"}, "country": {"text": "USA", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/usa"}, "duration": {"text": "4 Weeks", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/4-weeks"}, "frequency": {"text": "4-5 hours/week", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/4-5-hoursweek"}, "exam": {"text": "Yes, Paid Exam and/or Final Project", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/yes-paid-exam-andor-final-project"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Verified Certificate (Paid)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-verified-certificate-paid"}, "language": {"text": "English", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/english"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/fundamentos-do-google-para-o-ensino-coursera", "title": "Fundamentos do Google para o Ensino (Coursera)", "description": "STARTS\nEste curso \u00e9 oferecido pelo Google em parceria com a Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Lemann e a Foreducation, e tem como objetivo apresentar a educadores possibilidades de uso das tecnologias do Google para aumentar a efici\u00eancia, a inova\u00e7\u00e3o e a personaliza\u00e7\u00e3o do ensino.\nO conte\u00fado est\u00e1 dividido em cinco m\u00f3dulos:1.

Teams are essential to the modern organization, but most never reach their potential. Co-workers miscommunicate and groups struggle to adapt to changes in the market or their organizations. When teams lack self-awareness about these challenges, performance suffers. Based on years of team culture research and consulting experience, this course will help you understand the problems that hurt productivity and give you tools for creating positive change. This course will help you create the ground rules and structure to set your team up for success. You will gain the skills to diagnose issues such as conflicts, groupthink, and lack of commitment in your team before they get out of control. The course offers frameworks to adjust team behaviors and get the best performance out of your people. You will also understand frequent stumbling blocks for common team types, such as startups and virtual teams, and learn solutions tailored to each one.\nWEEK 2Setting Team FoundationsIn this first module, we will talk about how to get your team started off on the right foot with a process called team chartering. This is where you lay out the rules that your group will follow to give them the best chance for success. In particular, we will talk about how to create the right goals, team roles, and group norms to get the most out of each person.Graded: Creating a CharterGraded: Setting Team Foundations\nWEEK 3Diagnosing Team ProblemsIn this module, we\u2019ll look at why good teams go bad. We\u2019ll focus on those process losses I mentioned, and dig into the different problems that can derail your group from its goals. Since it can be hard to really pinpoint team problems and even harder to talk about them, we\u2019ll look at some methods that will help you do both.Graded: GM Team DisputeGraded: Diagnosing Team Problems\nWEEK 4Coaching Emotionally Intelligent TeamsIn this module, we move from discussion to action.

Les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s associ\u00e9es se d\u00e9clinent en trois dimensions : g\u00e9om\u00e9trique, th\u00e9matique et spatiale. Les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s des objets spatiaux sont d\u00e9crites par des indices selon leur forme, leur taille, la distribution spatiale ainsi que par le degr\u00e9 \u00e9ventuel de d\u00e9pendance spatiale. Tous ces indices interviennent, selon le contexte de l'\u00e9tude, pour caract\u00e9riser un paysage.\nWEEK 2Ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes spatiaux continusUn ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne est dit continu dans l'espace s\u2019il est d\u00e9fini en tout point de l'espace g\u00e9ographique et que ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s varient localement de mani\u00e8re graduelle et structur\u00e9e. L'altitude, l'humidit\u00e9 d'un sol, la teneur en m\u00e9taux lourds ou autres polluants des sols en sont des exemples. Ce chapitre traite des modes d'\u00e9chantillonnage, puis pr\u00e9sente les fonctions d'interpolation dites d\u00e9terministes car elles ne se basent sur aucune \u00e9tude pr\u00e9alable du ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne. Le c\u0153ur de la le\u00e7on est consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 une introduction \u00e0 la g\u00e9ostatistique bas\u00e9e sur la notion de fonction al\u00e9atoire. On traite successivement les concepts des variables r\u00e9gionalis\u00e9es, de la variographie et du krigeage.\nWEEK 3Mod\u00e8les num\u00e9riques d'altitudeLe relief est le facteur r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur et explicatif pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rant des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes survenus \u00e0 la surface de la Terre. Il a fortement conditionn\u00e9 et orient\u00e9 l\u2019appropriation de l\u2019espace g\u00e9ographique par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s humaines. Selon ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, les r\u00e8gnes animal et v\u00e9g\u00e9tal trouvent des conditions favorables \u00e0 leur \u00e9tablissement et \u00e0 leur d\u00e9veloppement. Il occupe, de ce fait, une place majeure en analyse spatiale et dans toute discipline dont l\u2019objet concerne les activit\u00e9s humaines ou des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes naturels. Ce chapitre pr\u00e9sente un bref historique des modes d\u2019acquisition de l\u2019altitude, puis expose les algorithmes et leurs propri\u00e9t\u00e9s permettant de d\u00e9river les indicateurs descriptifs du relief.\nWEEK 4Interactions entre couches de donn\u00e9esL'interaction entre couches fait appel au concept de superposition spatiale \u2013 spatial overlay en anglais \u2013 auquel sont li\u00e9es un ensemble de m\u00e9thodes qui permettent le transfert de donn\u00e9es entre divers objets stock\u00e9s dans des couches de diff\u00e9rents types (raster ou vecteur), ceci en fonction de leurs relations spatiales les uns avec les autres. L\u2019analyse de ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes distribu\u00e9s dans l\u2019espace g\u00e9ographique requiert souvent que l\u2019on recoure simultan\u00e9ment \u00e0 des informations provenant de couches distinctes. La superposition spatiale est la fonction embl\u00e9matique des syst\u00e8mes d\u2019information g\u00e9ographique. C\u2019est elle seule qui symbolise l\u2019originalit\u00e9 de ces syst\u00e8mes d\u2019information par rapport aux autres, et surtout qui leur conf\u00e8re toute leur puissance.Graded: W4.1 SuperpositionGraded: Assignment module 3\nWEEK 5S\u00e9miologie graphique et cartographie th\u00e9matiqueCette semaine, vous allez apprendre comment repr\u00e9senter l\u2019information g\u00e9ographique, notamment en appliquant les r\u00e8gles \u00e9tablies en cartographie th\u00e9matique. Sur cette base, vous apprendrez \u00e0 traiter l\u2019information quantitative ou qualitative que vous souhaitez communiquer, et nous vous apprendrons comment produire des cartes th\u00e9matiques dans QGIS avec l\u2019aide du composeur d\u2019impression.

A number of scientists and philosophers have taken up this challenge. There have been brain scans of meditators and philosophical examinations of Buddhist doctrines. There have even been discussions of Darwin and the Buddha: Do early Buddhist descriptions of the mind, and of the human condition, make particular sense in light of evolutionary psychology?\nThis course will examine how Buddhism is faring under this scrutiny. Are neuroscientists starting to understand how meditation \u201cworks\u201d? Would such an understanding validate meditation\u2014or might physical explanations of meditation undermine the spiritual significance attributed to it? And how are some of the basic Buddhist claims about the human mind holding up? We\u2019ll pay special attention to some highly counterintuitive doctrines: that the self doesn\u2019t exist, and that much of perceived reality is in some sense illusory. Do these claims, radical as they sound, make a certain kind of sense in light of modern psychology? And what are the implications of all this for how we should live our lives?

It was the beginning of the deadliest outbreak in recent history, caused by a mysterious bacterial strain that we will refer to as E. coli X. Soon, German officials linked the outbreak to a restaurant in L\u00fcbeck, where nearly 20% of the patrons had developed bloody diarrhea in a single week. At this point, biologists knew that they were facing a previously unknown pathogen and that traditional methods would not suffice \u2013 computational biologists would be needed to assemble and analyze the genome of the newly emerged pathogen.\nTo investigate the evolutionary origin and pathogenic potential of the outbreak strain, researchers started a crowdsourced research program. They released bacterial DNA sequencing data from one of a patient, which elicited a burst of analyses carried out by computational biologists on four continents.The 2011 German outbreak represented an early example of epidemiologists collaborating with computational biologists to stop an outbreak. In this Genome Assembly Programming Challenge, you will follow in the footsteps of the bioinformaticians investigating the outbreak by developing a program to assemble the genome of the E. coli X from millions of overlapping substrings of the E.coli X genome.\nCourse 6 of 6 in the Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization\nWEEK 1The 2011 European E. coli OutbreakIn April 2011, hundreds of people in Germany were hospitalized with a deadly disease that often started as food poisoning with bloody diarrhea. It was the beginning of the deadliest outbreak in recent history, caused by a mysterious bacterial strain that we will refer to as E. coli X. Within a few months, the outbreak had infected thousands and killed 53 people. To prevent the further spread of the outbreak, computational biologists all over the world had to answer the question \u201cWhat is the genome sequence of E. coli X?\u201d in order to figure out what new genes it acquired to become pathogenic. The 2011 German outbreak represented an early example of epidemiologists collaborating with computational biologists to stop an outbreak. In this Genome Assembly Programming Challenge, you will follow in the footsteps of the bioinformaticians investigating the outbreak by developing a program to assemble the genome of the deadly E. coli X strain. However, before you embark on building a program for assembling the E. coli X strain, we have to explain some genomic concepts and warm you up by having you solve a simpler problem of assembling a small virus.Graded: Programming Assignment 1: Assembling the phi 174X Genome Using Overlap Graphs\nWEEK 2Assembling Genomes Using de Bruijn GraphsDNA sequencing approach that led to assembly of a small virus in 1977 went through a series of transformations that contributed to the emergence of personalized medicine a few years ago. By the late 1980s, biologists were routinely sequencing viral genomes containing hundreds of thousands of nucleotides, but the idea of sequencing a bacterial (let alone the human) genome containing millions (or even billions) of nucleotides remained preposterous and would cost billions of dollars. In 1988, three biologists (independently and simultaneously!) came up with an idea to reduce sequencing cost and proposed the futuristic and at the time completely implausible method of DNA arrays. None of these three biologists could have possibly imagined that the implications of his own experimental research would eventually bring him face-to-face with challenging algorithmic problems. In this module you will learn about the algorithmic challenge of DNA sequencing using information about short k-mers provided by DNA arrays. You will also travel to the 18the century to learn about the Bridges of Konigsberg and solve a related problem of assembling a jigsaw puzzle!Graded: Programming Assignment 2: Assembling the phi 174X Genome Using De Bruijn Graphs\nWEEK 3Genome Assembly Faces Real Sequencing DataOur discussion of genome assembly has thus far relied upon various assumptions. In this module, we will face practical challenges introduced by quirks in modern sequencing technologies and discuss some algorithmic techniques that have been devised to address these challenges. Afterwards, you will assemble the smallest bacterial genome that lives symbiotically inside leafhoppers. Its sheltered life has allowed it to reduce its genome to only about 112,091 nucleotides and 137 genes. And afterwards, you will be ready to assemble the E. coli X genome!Graded: Programming Assignment 3: Genome Assembly Faces Real Sequencing Data\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Coursera", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/coursera"}, "university": {"text": "Higher School of Economics (HSE) - National Research University", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/higher-school-economics-hse-national-research-university"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Alexander S.

Parmenides of Elea formulated a powerful objection to all these proposals, while later Greek theorists (such as Anaxagoras and the atomist Democritus) attempted to answer that objection. In fifth-century Athens, Socrates insisted on the importance of the fundamental ethical question\u2014\u201cHow shall I live?\u201d\u2014and his pupil, Plato, and Plato\u2019s pupil, Aristotle, developed elaborate philosophical systems to explain the nature of reality, knowledge, and human happiness.

While some recovered from the destruction, others did not. But none responded to political catastrophe by fashioning the kind of elaborate and enduring monument to their own downfall that we find in the Bible. Most conquered populations viewed their subjugation as a source of shame. They consigned it to oblivion, opting instead to extol the golden ages of the past. The biblical authors in contrast reacted to loss by composing extensive writings that acknowledge collective failure, reflect deeply upon its causes, and discover thereby a ground for collective hope.\nWorking through colorful biblical and ancient Near Eastern texts, and drawing on an array of comparative examples, the course illustrates the thoroughgoing manner with which biblical authors responded to defeat by advancing a demotic agenda that places the community at the center. The aim of the biblical authors was to create a nation, and they sought to realize this goal via a shared text, which includes stories and songs, wisdom and laws. This corpus of writings belongs, without a doubt, to humanity\u2019s greatest achievements. Whereas the great civilizations of the Near East invested their energies and resources into monuments of stone that could be destroyed by invading armies, the biblical authors left a literary legacy that has been intensively studied until the present day. More important, these authors\u2019 visionary response to defeat brought to light a radical new wisdom: the notion that a people is greater than the state which governs it, and that a community can survive collapse when all of its members can claim a piece of the pie and therefore have a reason to take an active part in its collective life.\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Coursera", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/coursera"}, "university": {"text": "Emory University", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/emory-university"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Jacob L.

Les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s associ\u00e9es se d\u00e9clinent en trois dimensions : g\u00e9om\u00e9trique, th\u00e9matique et spatiale. Les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s des objets spatiaux sont d\u00e9crites par des indices selon leur forme, leur taille, la distribution spatiale ainsi que par le degr\u00e9 \u00e9ventuel de d\u00e9pendance spatiale. Tous ces indices interviennent, selon le contexte de l'\u00e9tude, pour caract\u00e9riser un paysage.\nWEEK 2Ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes spatiaux continusUn ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne est dit continu dans l'espace s\u2019il est d\u00e9fini en tout point de l'espace g\u00e9ographique et que ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s varient localement de mani\u00e8re graduelle et structur\u00e9e. L'altitude, l'humidit\u00e9 d'un sol, la teneur en m\u00e9taux lourds ou autres polluants des sols en sont des exemples. Ce chapitre traite des modes d'\u00e9chantillonnage, puis pr\u00e9sente les fonctions d'interpolation dites d\u00e9terministes car elles ne se basent sur aucune \u00e9tude pr\u00e9alable du ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne. Le c\u0153ur de la le\u00e7on est consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 une introduction \u00e0 la g\u00e9ostatistique bas\u00e9e sur la notion de fonction al\u00e9atoire. On traite successivement les concepts des variables r\u00e9gionalis\u00e9es, de la variographie et du krigeage.\nWEEK 3Mod\u00e8les num\u00e9riques d'altitudeLe relief est le facteur r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur et explicatif pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rant des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes survenus \u00e0 la surface de la Terre. Il a fortement conditionn\u00e9 et orient\u00e9 l\u2019appropriation de l\u2019espace g\u00e9ographique par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s humaines. Selon ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, les r\u00e8gnes animal et v\u00e9g\u00e9tal trouvent des conditions favorables \u00e0 leur \u00e9tablissement et \u00e0 leur d\u00e9veloppement. Il occupe, de ce fait, une place majeure en analyse spatiale et dans toute discipline dont l\u2019objet concerne les activit\u00e9s humaines ou des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes naturels. Ce chapitre pr\u00e9sente un bref historique des modes d\u2019acquisition de l\u2019altitude, puis expose les algorithmes et leurs propri\u00e9t\u00e9s permettant de d\u00e9river les indicateurs descriptifs du relief.\nWEEK 4Interactions entre couches de donn\u00e9esL'interaction entre couches fait appel au concept de superposition spatiale \u2013 spatial overlay en anglais \u2013 auquel sont li\u00e9es un ensemble de m\u00e9thodes qui permettent le transfert de donn\u00e9es entre divers objets stock\u00e9s dans des couches de diff\u00e9rents types (raster ou vecteur), ceci en fonction de leurs relations spatiales les uns avec les autres. L\u2019analyse de ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes distribu\u00e9s dans l\u2019espace g\u00e9ographique requiert souvent que l\u2019on recoure simultan\u00e9ment \u00e0 des informations provenant de couches distinctes. La superposition spatiale est la fonction embl\u00e9matique des syst\u00e8mes d\u2019information g\u00e9ographique. C\u2019est elle seule qui symbolise l\u2019originalit\u00e9 de ces syst\u00e8mes d\u2019information par rapport aux autres, et surtout qui leur conf\u00e8re toute leur puissance.Graded: W4.1 SuperpositionGraded: Assignment module 3\nWEEK 5S\u00e9miologie graphique et cartographie th\u00e9matiqueCette semaine, vous allez apprendre comment repr\u00e9senter l\u2019information g\u00e9ographique, notamment en appliquant les r\u00e8gles \u00e9tablies en cartographie th\u00e9matique. Sur cette base, vous apprendrez \u00e0 traiter l\u2019information quantitative ou qualitative que vous souhaitez communiquer, et nous vous apprendrons comment produire des cartes th\u00e9matiques dans QGIS avec l\u2019aide du composeur d\u2019impression. L'\u00e9laboration des cartes th\u00e9matiques doit \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e en respectant un certain nombre de contraintes dont le respect va favoriser l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 de la transmission de l\u2019information. Il s\u2019agit par exemple d\u2019utiliser les couleurs en suivant les r\u00e8gles de la s\u00e9miologie graphique, ou de faire figurer toutes les composantes utiles \u2013 comme par exemple une l\u00e9gende, une \u00e9chelle, des sources, un commentaire \u2013 pour permettre une lecture optimale.\nWEEK 6Autres formes de repr\u00e9sentationCette derni\u00e8re semaine est consacr\u00e9e \u00e0 des cas particuliers de la repr\u00e9sentation de l'information g\u00e9ographique, soit \u00e0 la cartographie dynamique et interactive sur Internet, \u00e0 la repr\u00e9sentation en 3 dimensions, et finalement \u00e0 la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 augment\u00e9e et \u00e0 sa combinaison avec les syst\u00e8mes d'information g\u00e9ographique.Graded: Assignment module 4\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Coursera", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/coursera"}, "university": {"text": "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/%C3%A9cole-polytechnique-f%C3%A9d%C3%A9rale-de-lausanne"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Amadou Sall", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/amadou-sall"}, {"text": "Fernand Koffi Kouam\u00e9", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/fernand-koffi-kouam%C3%A9"}, {"text": "Marc Soutter", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/marc-soutter"}, {"text": "St\u00e9phane Joost", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/st%C3%A9phane-joost"}], "category": {"text": "Engineering", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/engineering"}, "country": {"text": "Switzerland", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/switzerland"}, "duration": {"text": "6 Weeks", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/6-weeks"}, "frequency": {"text": "2-3 hours/week", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/2-3-hoursweek"}, "exam": {"text": "No Exam or Final Project", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/no-exam-or-final-project"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Verified Certificate (Paid)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-verified-certificate-paid"}, "language": {"text": "French", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/french"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/science-training-young-athletes-coursera", "title": "The Science of Training Young Athletes (Coursera)", "description": "STARTS\nSeventy percent of kids drop out of sports before their high school graduation. Only 15% leave because they feel they are not good enough. Almost 70% leave because they were not having fun, or due to problems with the coach. Injuries cause 30% to give up sports. This course is packed full of practical sports science information that provide youth coaches and parents with the practical pediatric sports science insights to successfully retain young athletes and develop their sport potential while avoiding injury and overtraining.\nWe begin by examining the multidimensional nature of coaching, the relevant sport motor performance abilities, the impact of growth and development on motor skills, the gene versus practice controversy, and briefly overview the body structures strengthened through training. Then we explore the athlete's energy supply, where this energy comes from, and how it matures along with the athlete.

The new context demands renewal of your capabilities and development of different mindsets. In this course, you\u2019ll learn the different components of emotional intelligence at work.\nFor example, you\u2019ll learn how you can work effectively in teams, build cooperative relationships with your key stakeholders, exercise effective influence, handle difficult conversations, and create energy and enthusiasm to foster meaningful change. Our modules will begin with powerful stories that are illustrative of typical challenges faced by front-line leaders. We\u2019ll analyze the case illustration using the ideas from emotional intelligence theory, and highlight the key lessons that you should take away in terms of mindsets and skills that you should master to distinguish yourself as a leader.\nCourse 5 of 6 in the Business Technology Management Specialization.\nWEEK 1Leaders as IndividualAs frontline leaders, it is important for you to recognize your moods and emotions. You need a deeper understanding of the emotional needs that drive you and shape your behavior. Management research shows that the behavioral competencies are highly important for individuals with leadership responsibility. In fact, without behavioral competencies, even otherwise bright individuals fail in managerial and leadership roles. These competencies are not innate; they are learned through guided introspection and practice. This module will deal with the topics of emotional intelligence, self-awareness, interpersonal relations, leadership skills and mindsets, avoiding the trap of derailment, and building personal development plan. We also have an interview with a senior industry practitioner on competencies of an effective leader.Graded: Graded Quiz\nWEEK 2Leaders as Relationship BuilderPeople are at the center of any organization. For leaders to achieve organizational goals, they need to understand the people they are leading. To be effective, a leader has to allocate significant time and effort to build and develop cooperative relationships with key internal and external stakeholders. Building and maintaining relationships is a critical competence for effective leaders. This is aimed at not just direct reports. You also need positive relations with peers, bosses, senior leaders, people at operating levels and relevant others outside the organization. When there is mutual trust, influence and credibility, organizational work becomes easier. In short, relationships are critical for leadership success. This module will focus on the topics of listening, coaching and feedback, delegation and building effective teams. We also have an interview with an industry expert on building resonant relationships.Graded: Graded Quiz\nWEEK 3Leader as Influencer and CollaboratorOrganizations are teams of teams. By definition, a manager gets work done not only through one\u2019s own resources and efforts, but also through others. In other words, you are required to work effectively with people outside your team. These are individuals and groups within the organization and also outside. You have to influence people at different levels and functions, build collaborative relationships wherever possible, negotiate wisely, handle difficult conversations and make decisions in the face of uncertainty and complexity. In this complex arena, formal authority or position power is only a limited resource. You have to influence without authority, and this will require you to draw on your personal power, resources and approaches. You have to develop skills and mindsets for the challenges of managing conflict, handling difficult conversations and carrying out effective negotiations. This module will deal with the topics of influence, conflict management, handling difficult conversations, negotiation and decision making. As a part of this module, we have two interviews \u2013 one with a negotiation expert on what it takes to be an effective negotiator, and the second with an industry expert on the topic of complex decision making.Graded: Graded Quiz\nWEEK 4Leader as Change AgentResearch and practice show that managers and organisations face huge difficulties in reaching set targets through their change management initiatives. As a frontline leader, you are expected to bring about changes without having the authority to issue orders or give directives.You won\u2019t have all the authority and resources, and yet you would be expected to bring about effective changes in your sphere of functioning. Changes are required to respond to newer opportunities and threats faster than your competitors. You would be expected to be both change agents and bring about effective changes; and at the same time, change recipients and operate within the framework of a larger mandate or organisational direction given to you from higher levels. Not surprisingly, leading change has become a highly critical managerial competence. This module will cover Lewin\u2019s foundational model of change, Kotter\u2019s influential framework of change management, levels of resistance to change and change leadership competencies.Graded: Graded Quiz\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Coursera", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/coursera"}, "university": {"text": "Indian School of Business (ISB)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/indian-school-business-isb"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Ramnarayan Subramaniam", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/ramnarayan-subramaniam"}], "category": {"text": "Management & Leadership", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/management-leadership"}, "country": {"text": "India", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/india"}, "duration": {"text": "4 Weeks", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/4-weeks"}, "frequency": {"text": "No information", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/no-information"}, "exam": {"text": "Yes, Paid Exam and/or Final Project", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/yes-paid-exam-andor-final-project"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Verified Certificate (Paid)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-verified-certificate-paid"}, "language": {"text": "English", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/english"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/musicianship-chord-charts-diatonic-chords-and-minor-keys-coursera", "title": "Musicianship: Chord Charts, Diatonic Chords, and Minor Keys (Coursera)", "description": "STARTS\nAfter a tremendous response from learners on Coursera, Berklee Online has created a Developing Your Musicianship specialization, and this course is the second course in the series.

GVV is not about persuading people to be more ethical, but instead it starts from the premise that most of us already want to act on our values, but that we also want to feel that we have a reasonable chance of doing so effectively.\nThrough positive, real life examples, pre-scripting, rehearsal and peer coaching, GVV builds the skill, the confidence and likelihood that we will act on our values more often and more successfully. Based on research and practice, with over 1,000 pilots in educational settings and companies on all seven continents, GVV helps answer the questions: \u201cWhat if I were going to act on my values? What would I say and do? How could I be most effective?\u201dYou will come away from this course with an expanded toolkit, as well as practice, in a variety of methods and techniques for voicing and enacting your own values and principle. You will develop and practice leadership skills in \"peer coaching\u201d with other Learners. Through cases and stories based on recognizable workplace, classroom and life values conflicts, you will apply the GVV techniques and \u201cre-frames\u201d, expanding your repertoire for possible action as well as identifying and rehearsing responses that are likely to be most effective. Through this practice, you will gain greater confidence and competence in voicing and enacting your values effectively.\nWho is this class for: The course provides an introduction to GVV for managers and/or corporate trainers who wish to use it in their companies; for faculty who wish to introduce GVV in their teaching; and for Individual Learners and Students who, just like an ethical athlete, wish to develop their \u201cmoral muscle memory.\u201d\nWEEK 1What is Giving Voice to Values? Why and How it WorksWelcome to week one of the course! What kinds of values conflicts have you experienced in your life? Has there been a time in your life where you have been faced with a values conflict and didn't know how to speak up, or what to say? During this week, you'll first be introduced to a story called The Client That Fell Through the Cracks. This story provides an example of the kind of values conflict that we all can encounter in the workplace, and how to address it by effectively acting on your values. Next, you'll explore what Giving Voice to Values (GVV) is and who uses it. You'll hear from practitioners in business, higher education, and the military in regards to why and how they used GVV to address their workplace challenges. We'll discover how research informs GVV in developing a moral muscle memory, and how this innovative approach is different from traditional approaches to ethics. Then you'll be briefly introduced to the seven pillars that form the foundation of GVV. Finally, we'll spend some time examining in more depth the first two pillars, Values and Purpose. By the end of this module, you'll realize in the face of values conflicts there is power and impact in asking yourself a new question, \"What if I was going to act on my values--what would I say and do?\"Graded: GVV SurveyGraded: Week One\nWEEK 2Recognizing and Learning From Your Success and FailuresWhat are some of your own individual successes and failures at effectively voicing and acting on your values? What conditions made it easier for you to speak and act, and which conditions made it more difficult? We will spend week two of the course recognizing and reflecting on your responses to these questions so that you can gain some insights into your own strengths, abilities, and personal styles that empower you to act on your values. You'll do so by continuing to explore the pillars of GVV by taking an in depth look at Choice, Normalization, and Self-Knowledge and Alignment. Often people do not act on their values because they felt as though they had no choice. We learn that we often have more options than we believe we do. The Normalization pillar helps us perceive values conflicts as a normal everyday part of our lives. The Self-Knowledge and Alignment pillar helps us understand how to identify and use our strengths and abilities to effectively act on our values. Finally, we will hear a story about Ceilia and how she framed a challenge that played to her strengths to address a values conflict in her work. By the end of this module, you'll be able to identify and consider your own strengths and preferences for values expression in your career and your broader life.Graded: Exercise: A Tale of Two StoriesGraded: GVV Personal-Professional ProfileGraded: Week Two\nWEEK 3Developing Scripts and Action PlansWelcome to Week 3! During this week you'll start to build a \"tool-kit\" for ways to feel more confident and comfortable in voicing your values. You'll discover how to develop scripts and action plans. First, you'll explore the GVV pillar, Voice. This pillar helps you understand how you can examine the different ways to build your capacity for voice and the variety of forms it can take. Next, you'll be introduced to the final pillar, Reasons and Rationalizations. This pillar helps you understand how to anticipate the objections that you might face when trying to voice your values. By doing so, you can prepare and practice effective responses to these objections. Then you'll discover some of the challenges and opportunities you may face in voicing your values based on your level and position within an organization. Recognizing these challenges and opportunities can help you identify which levers you can use to address them. Two cases are provided to illustrate the point that you can find effective strategies for acting on your values at all levels of experience and authority. By the end of the module you will have identified tools that you can use to help you voice your values effectively. You'll use these newly acquired tools to revisit your Tale of Two Stories and craft a new ending.Graded: Week 3 QuizGraded: A Tale of Two Stories: The Do-Over\nWEEK 4ADDRESSING CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE GVV APPROACHWhat are some challenges and opportunities you might face in developing values-driven leadership? How might GVV address these challenges and opportunities? This final module addresses some of these challenges and opportunities of values driven leadership development within business and education contexts for managers, corporate users, faculty, and senior leaders. You'll then review some of the core lessons of GVV to apply to work and your individual lives. Finally, you'll hear again from the practitioners from week one in business, higher education, and the military in regards to their implementation process, impacts, and insights gained from using GVV in their workplaces. By the end of this module, you'll be able to create an individualized GVV Implementation Plan.Graded: Week 4 QuizGraded: Giving Voice to Values Implementation Plan\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Coursera", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/coursera"}, "university": {"text": "University of Virginia", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/university-virginia"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Mary Gentile", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/mary-gentile"}], "category": {"text": "Management & Leadership", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/management-leadership"}, "country": {"text": "USA", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/usa"}, "duration": {"text": "4 Weeks", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/4-weeks"}, "frequency": {"text": "3-4 hours/week", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/3-4-hoursweek"}, "exam": {"text": "Yes, Paid Exam and/or Final Project", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/yes-paid-exam-andor-final-project"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Verified Certificate (Paid)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-verified-certificate-paid"}, "language": {"text": "English", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/english"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/writing-skills-engineering-leaders-coursera", "title": "Writing Skills for Engineering Leaders (Coursera)", "description": "STARTS\nEngineering leaders must write extensively for their jobs, and their writing needs to be professional, reader-focused, and error-free.

It shows that rather than develop into a full blown market economy, state and party officials at all levels of the political system maintain significant influence in economic development. Such a \u201cpolitical\u201d economy has had both positive and negative outcomes, which we will assess in detail.\nWe also look at the origins, views, backgrounds and relations among leaders, and how those leaders make decisions about public policy and try to get those decisions implemented down through the system.

His penetrating analyses are still highly relevant today and have been seen as insightful for the leading figures of Existentialism, Post-Structuralism and Post-Modernism.\nIt is often claimed that relativism, subjectivism and nihilism are typically modern philosophical problems that emerge with the breakdown of traditional values, customs and ways of life. The result is the absence of meaning, the lapse of religious faith, and feeling of alienation that is so widespread in modernity.The Danish thinker S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (1813-55) gave one of the most penetrating analyses of this complex phenomenon of modernity. But somewhat surprisingly he seeks insight into it not in any modern thinker but rather in an ancient one, the Greek philosopher Socrates.\nWEEK 1Course Introduction: The Life and Work of Kierkegaard as a \"Socratic Task\"In this first unit, the basic premise of the class is presented, namely, the idea that Kierkegaard used Socrates as his model. The lecture begins by taking a brief look at Kierkegaard\u2019s early life: his family background and his education at the School of Civic Virtue in Copenhagen. We then turn to The Concept of Irony and to understand its structure and argumentative strategy. Since Kierkegaard sees himself as fulfilling a Socratic task, it is important to gain some insight into the thought of Socrates in order to determine exactly what it is that this means. So this week\u2019s lesson looks briefly at a couple of Plato\u2019s dialogues, Euthyphro and The Apology, which Kierkegaard studied carefully. After each analysis a brief account of Kierkegaard\u2019s use or appropriation of the given idea is sketched.Graded: Course Introduction\nWEEK 2Kierkegaard, Martensen and HegelianismKierkegaard\u2019s understanding of Socrates was of course based on his reading of the texts of Plato, Xenophon and Aristophanes, that is, the primary sources. But it was also largely shaped by the interpretation of the famous German philosopher G.W.F. Hegel, with whom he was in a constant critical dialogue in The Concept of Irony. Hegel\u2019s philosophy was a highly popular trend at the University of Copenhagen in the late 1830s when Kierkegaard was a student and was writing this work. So this week explores first the presence of Hegel at the university during Kierkegaard\u2019s time, and then Hegel\u2019s analysis of Socrates. This provides the opportunity to revisit and build on the key topics that were introduced in the first lecture: Socratic irony, aporia, the daimon, etc. It is shown how Kierkegaard is inspired and influenced by the important historical role that Hegel ascribes to the person of Socrates. This week also continues the biographical narrative of the young Kierkegaard. It sketches his life as a young student at the University of Copenhagen and his trip to Gilleleje, where he wrote the famous journal entry about seeking a truth for which to live and die. This provides the opportunity to introduce the figure of Hans Lassen Martensen, who was a lifelong rival for Kierkegaard and an important figure in the Danish reception of Hegel\u2019s philosophy.Graded: Kierkegaard, Martensen and Hegelianism\nWEEK 3Kierkegaard\u2019s View of SocratesThe goal in this lecture is to have a look at Kierkegaard\u2019s understanding of Socrates and to see where he agrees with Hegel and where he disagrees. We look at Kierkegaard\u2019s analysis of Socrates\u2019 daimon, the trial and conviction of Socrates, the relation of Socrates to the Sophists and to the later schools of philosophy. An account is also given of how Kierkegaard was quite exercised by Hans Lassen Martensen and his lectures at the University of Copenhagen. We explore Kierkegaard\u2019s response to Martensen\u2019s article on Faust, and Kierkegaard\u2019s two satirical works that were aimed at Martensen and his students, namely, The Conflict between the Old and the New Soap Cellars and Johannes Climacus or De Omnibus dubitandum est. Finally, we also introduce a lesser-known Danish figure, Andreas Frederik Beck, who wrote the first book review of The Concept of Irony\u2014a review that gives us a brief snapshot into the contemporary assessment of the work and also affords some insight into Kierkegaard\u2019s view of it when we see his negative reaction to Beck\u2019s comments.Graded: Kierkegaard\u2019s View of Socrates\nWEEK 4Kierkegaard, Heiberg and HistoryKierkegaard is interested in the problem of the meaninglessness of life. He regards this as an important modern phenomenon that must be taken seriously. This lecture begins with a treatment of the second part of The Concept of Irony, where Kierkegaard examines different forms of what he calls \u201cmodern irony.\u201d The positions that he looks at are very similar to that of the modern nihilist. We examine this analysis to see what insights it might hold for the modern problem of the absence of meaning in our 21st century world. This lecture introduces Kierkegaard\u2019s contemporary Johan Ludvig Heiberg, who tried to alert his age to the crisis of nihilism and subjectivism in a way that anticipates some of Kierkegaard\u2019s considerations. In this lecture we go through Kierkegaard\u2019s critical assessment of Hegel\u2019s understanding of Socrates and history. We try to see where Kierkegaard follows Hegel and where he strikes out on his own.Graded: Kierkegaard, Heiberg and History\nWEEK 5Kierkegaard, M\u00f8ller and SchlegelDuring this unit, we will continue the analysis of the second part of The Concept of Irony. Here Kierkegaard introduces the irony of the German Romantics as a contrastive form of irony to that of Socrates. We begin with Kierkegaard\u2019s account of Fichte\u2019s theory of subjectivity which, he (following Hegel) claims is the forerunner to Romantic irony. This then leads to Kierkegaard\u2019s account of the appropriation of Fichte\u2019s theory by the Romantic authors, Friedrich von Schlegel and Ludwig Tieck. This lecture also introduces one of Kierkegaard\u2019s great mentors, Poul Martin M\u00f8ller, who was also interested in an analysis of Romantic irony as a form of modern nihilism. We see how Kierkegaard is critical of Romantic irony as \u201chistorically unjustified,\u201d while he continues his praise of Socratic irony. Finally, we continue the biographical narrative of Kierkegaard\u2019s life with an account of his relation to and broken engagement with Regine Olsen.Graded: Kierkegaard, M\u00f8ller and Schlegel\nWEEK 6The Trip to Berlin and the Beginning of the AuthorshipThis unit looks at the years that immediately followed Kierkegaard\u2019s The Concept of Irony, namely, from 1841 to 1843. From the autumn of 1841 to the spring of 1842 Kierkegaard was in Berlin where he heard the lectures of the German philosopher Schelling. During this time he struggled with what he wanted to do with his life. He decided to became a writer and, drawing on the knowledge gained from his dissertation, to use Socrates as his model. We examine Kierkegaard\u2019s breakthrough work, Either/Or, which appeared at the beginning of 1843. This work develops in a literary way some aspects of the character of the Romantic ironist that he explored in the second half of his dissertation. We also examine Johan Ludvig Heiberg\u2019s critical review of this work. We briefly mention the key works that Kierkegaard published after Either/Or, namely, Repetition, Fear and Trembling and his series of edifying or upbuilding discourses. We look in some detail at Kierkegaard\u2019s conception of the nature of faith as presented in Fear and Trembling. His conception is a highly troubling one that raises important questions for religious life today.Graded: The Trip to Berlin and the Beginning of the Authorship\nWEEK 7The Development of the Pseudonymous WorksThe years 1844 to 1846 were perhaps the most productive in Kierkegaard\u2019s entire life. In this lecture we explore the series of famous works that he penned during this time, among others, the Philosophical Fragments, The Concept of Anxiety, Prefaces, Stages on Life\u2019s Way and the Concluding Unscientific Postscript. These books present a complex series of works ostensibly authored by different pseudonyms, each with his own agenda and intentions. At first glance, this might all look like a playful chaos or a straightforward kind of madness on Kierkegaard\u2019s side. But in this lecture we try to make sense of Kierkegaard\u2019s plan with these works and their complex relations to one another. We see that many of the main motifs concerning Socrates that Kierkegaard originally treated in The Concept of Irony now reappear in different contexts in these later works. This is particularly interesting when we consider that these works treat important Christian concepts such as the incarnation, the revelation, faith, sin, and forgiveness. Many people might think that it is outrageous to believe that a pagan philosopher can help to understand these Christian concepts. Here we can catch a glimpse of the radicality of Kierkegaard\u2019s thought. He believes that Socrates has some important insights for Christians today. This lecture also continues the biographical narrative by highlighting Kierkegaard\u2019s polemic with Johan Ludvig Heiberg and his conflict with the satirical journal, The Corsair. The lecture ends with a discussion of the Concluding Unscientific Postscript, which Kierkegaard believed would be his last work before he died. We explore Kierkegaard\u2019s conception of a parallel authorship that features a series of pseudonymous works that run parallel to a series of signed works, which are intended to treat the same topics but in different ways.Graded: The Development of the Pseudonymous Works\nWEEK 8The 2nd Half of the Authorship and the Attack on the ChurchThe last decade of Kierkegaard\u2019s life was in many ways the most dramatic. This was the time of the Revolution of 1848 and of Kierkegaard\u2019s public attack on the Danish state church in his final years. This period represents what Kierkegaard scholars refer to as the second half of the authorship, namely, the period from 1846 after the Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Kierkegaard\u2019s death in 1855. In this lecture we explore some of Kierkegaard\u2019s main works from these years, such as A Literary Review of Two Ages, Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, The Sickness unto Death, Practice in Christianity and The Moment. We will see how some of the themes and motifs that we have examined re-appear in these works. In our exploration of these texts it will become evident that even as Kierkegaard grows older, he continues to return to the figure of Socrates as a source of inspiration. Indeed, he never abandons the great hero of his youth. Even in the last text that he ever completed before his death, he explicitly states that Socrates was the only model that he used for his work. Our goal in this lecture is, among other things, to try to understand what he means by this. The lecture ends with a biographical account of Kierkegaard\u2019s attack on the Danish State Church, his final illness and death.Graded: The 2nd Half of the Authorship and the Attack on the ChurchGraded: Final Peer Assessed Essay\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Coursera", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/coursera"}, "university": {"text": "University of Copenhagen", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/university-copenhagen"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Jon Stewart", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/jon-stewart"}], "category": {"text": "Humanities", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/humanities"}, "country": {"text": "Denmark", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/denmark"}, "duration": {"text": "8 Weeks", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/8-weeks"}, "frequency": {"text": "4-6 hours/week", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/4-6-hoursweek"}, "exam": {"text": "Yes Exam and/or Final Project", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/yes-exam-andor-final-project"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Verified Certificate (Paid)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-verified-certificate-paid"}, "language": {"text": "English", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/english"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/applied-text-mining-python-coursera", "title": "Applied Text Mining in Python (Coursera)", "description": "STARTS\n This course will introduce the learner to text mining and text manipulation basics.

Nevertheless, it is our hope that much of the course content will still be of value to those in other parts of the world.\nKeywords: Nonprofit; Nonprofit Sector; Voluntary Sector; Nonprofit Organizations, Non-Governmental Organizations, Volunteer Organizations, Leadership, Management, Governance, Board, Board of Directors, Performance, EffectivenessCourse 1 Overview:Week 1: Some of the questions you will explore this week are: What is the nonprofit sector and why does it exist? What are the unique characteristics of nonprofit organizations? What are the trends and emerging issues facing organizations in the nonprofit sector?Week 2: Questions to be explored this week are: What is leadership at the governance level and how is it different from management? What is good governance and why does it matter? What is a board of directors?Week 3: This week's questions: What roles do board members play in nonprofit organizations? Broadly speaking, what are boards responsible for and how do they go about their work? What are some of the issues that challenge the board's ability to go its work?Week 4: At this stage, you are asked to review the course content, submit a written assignment (known lightheartedly as a BEAR (Board Effectiveness Readiness Assessment), and take two multiple choice Readiness Assurance Tests (known similarly as RATs). One RAT will assess knowledge and reading comprehension and the other will test application of knowledge within a practical case.Week 5: We will encourage you to discuss the RATs in the discussion forums and take them again should you wish to change any of your answers based on the information exchanged.\nIntroduction to the Nonprofit Sector, Nonprofit Organizations, Nonprofit Leadership and Governance is course 1 of 4 in the Improving Leadership & Governance in Nonprofit Organisations Specialisation.Identify and analyze leadership and governance issues, create practical ways to improve board performance and work with boards to implement these improvements.

How can we prove this? In particular, we will examine a result that claimed that peptides harvested from a T. rex fossil closely matched peptides found in chickens. In particular, we will use methods from computational proteomics to ask how we could assess whether this result is valid or due to some form of contamination.\nFinally, you will learn how to apply popular bioinformatics software tools to reconstruct an evolutionary tree of ebolaviruses and identify the source of the recent Ebola epidemic that caused global headlines.\nMolecular Evolution (Bioinformatics IV) is course 4 of 7 in the Bioinformatics Specialization.\nWho is this class for: This course is primarily aimed at undergraduate-level learners in computer science, biology, or a related field who are interested in learning about how the intersection of these two disciplines represents an important frontier in modern science.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nWEEK 1Introduction to Evolutionary Tree Construction\nWEEK 2More Algorithms for Constructing Trees from Distance MatricesLast week, we started to see how evolutionary trees can be constructed from distance matrices. \u00a0This week, we will encounter additional algorithms for this purpose, including the neighbor-joining algorithm, which has become one of the top-ten most cited papers in all of science since its introduction three decades ago.\nWEEK 3Constructing Evolutionary Trees from CharactersOver the last two weeks, we have seen several different algorithms for constructing evolutionary trees from distance matrices.This week, we will conclude the current chapter by considering what happens if we use properties called \"characters\" instead of distances. We will also see how to infer the ancestral states of organisms in an evolutionary tree, and consider whether it is possible to define an efficient algorithm for this task.\nWEEK 4Did birds evolve from dinosaurs? Over the next two weeks, we will see how we could analyze molecular evidence in support of this theory.\nWEEK 5Resolving the T. rex Peptides Mystery?Last week, we asked whether it is possible for dinosaur peptides to survive locked inside of a fossil for 65 million years.

People have become more critical of European policy and often seem to prefer local policy solutions in response to globalization problems. This becomes clear from the rise of Eurosceptic parties in many EU member states and it is also reflected in the results of several referendums. Earlier this year voters in the Netherlands said \u2018no\u2019 to the Association agreement with the Ukraine. In the UK, voters supported leaving the EU with a small margin. These developments make it important to clarify whether and how European policy is beneficial to you. So, how do you experience EU policy? Does it provide you with benefits? And if not, how can we change this?\nWe will talk with experts from all over Europe to get insights from behind the scenes. You will learn how policy is transferred to member states, and we will discuss the challenges of this multi-level structure and focus on the main causes of policy failure or success. On this journey we will encounter actual policy: how easy is it to establish yourself in another EU-country? How do governments make sure that the air you breathe is clean? And who is responsible?In this course we work with leading cases that will help you put your knowledge into practice. You will also do research together in your own local setting. Research on implementation in which you can make comparisons between different countries or areas. If you live outside the EU, this is not a problem. We have developed assignments in such a way that you can do research in your area and compare your findings with others. This unique feature makes it possible to compare implementation in Beijing, S\u00e3o Paulo or Cairo with Rome, Paris or Berlin.So are you curious to find out what Europe can do for you?

The course begins by situating our contemporary mental health practices in historical context, then looks at different aspects of mental health, mental illness and mental health services and their connections to what\u2019s going on in our social environment.\nMental health and mental illness used to be something that people didn\u2019t talk about, but now it seems every time we open a newspaper we are hearing about the importance of mental health, or the consequences of mental illness. At this point in our history we understand mental illness and mental health to be largely influenced by biological factors, specifically, workings of the brain. At the same time, we have always known that social factors play a very strong role in promoting mental health and can make big differences in who gets mentally ill, who gets treated for mental illness, and how people can achieve good quality of life after a mental health diagnosis.\nThis course is an opportunity to explore how social practices and ideas contribute to the ways in which society, families and individuals are affected by mental health and mental illness. We will look at issues like why some people think mental illness is a myth, how people think about mental health and illness in different cultures, who gets mentally ill and why, how families are affected by mental illness and what interventions are available to treat mental illness and promote mental health.\nWEEK 1Welcome and A Brief History of MadnessWe begin with a quick orientation to the course and continue with our first lecture topic: A brief history of madness.Graded: Commentary\nWEEK 2What is mental health and what causes mental illness?\nWEEK 3The social context of diagnosis and treatment of mental illnessesGraded: Personal Reflection\nWEEK 4Culture, mental health and mental illness\nWEEK 5Families, caregiving and mental illness\nWEEK 6society, communities and mental healthGraded: Final Assignment\nSuggested Readings:Mental Health Social Work Practice in CanadaMad Travelers: Reflections on the Reality of Transient Mental IllnessesA Sociology of Mental Health and IllnessMental Health, Race and Culture\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Coursera", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/coursera"}, "university": {"text": "University of Toronto", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/university-toronto"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Charmaine C.

Most of us know that vocals serve as the focal point of modern recordings but many do not know the tools used or when the tools are used best in modern record production.\nThe course begins with simple vocal placement in a mix, where you will also learn the fundamentals of compression and equalization. You\u2019ll further study delays and reverbs before moving to advanced concepts in audio editing, synthetic processing, automatic & graphic pitch correction, time compression, time expansion, flex and elastic audio.Through analysis and/or hands on projects that the students will post for peer review, the student will gain an understanding of the many choices available to modern record producers as they record and mix with a modern tool set. You\u2019ll see, in action, the Vocoder, Auto Tune, Melodyne, Elastic Audio, Flex Time, Vocalign, tempo based editing and a host of other file modification protocols that are readily available on most Digital Audio Workstations. This course gives students a thorough look at the expanded choices that have risen in the art of vocal production as a result of these modern tools.The goal of the course is to help interested novices understand the recordings they are listening to, performers find an expanded language for their recorded voices and for vocal producers to be able to create musically artistic visualizations using singers as their paintbrushes.\nWho is this class for: No prior songwriting or music production experience is necessary, although it is helpful. You should have a keen interest in music production, and a desire to share your music with others.\nWEEK 1Welcome To The Art of Vocal ProductionWelcome to The Art of Vocal Production! In this module, we will cover all the details about how this course works and what you'll need to know to get the most out of your course experience.Natural Vocal Design: How Vocal Producers CreateBy the end of this lesson you will understand vocal placement within the stereo field and how recording a vocalist multiple times can create various types of listening experiences. You will understand level, phase, phantom center, panning, balance, equalization and compression concepts used in modern recordings. Your ability to listen to music will be expanded and you will probably never listen to vocals in music the same way ever again once you have been exposed to these simple conceptsGraded: The VoiceGraded: Working with the Voice\nWEEK 2Artificial Vocal Design: How Vocal Producers \u201cSweeten\u201d the CreationIn this lesson, we will lean less on the vocalist and more on tools that can be used to change the way we listen to vocals in music. You will now understand how delays and reverbs have been used in the music you love and their relationship to time and tempo.Your desire to try out some of these techniques will be piqued by the time you finish this lesson.Graded: Vocal Effects\nWEEK 3Vocal Time Compression and Expansion: Tools of the TradeIn this lesson the nature of the DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) will be demystified and simplified. You will understand time as an absolute concept, time as a relative concept and further grasp the utility of the sample rate and bit depth parameters in your audio software. You will be shown tools that can change a song from a ballad to a dance record and vice versa. Many modern vocal production tools exist in software that might already be on your computer; but if you do not have such tools, you will document the use of these concepts via in depth analysis of current and emerging music.Graded: Tools of the Trade\nWEEK 4Vocal Pitch Correction and Tuning: More tools of the TradeIn this lesson, you will learn some of the industry standard pitch correction and tuning tools. Although you will gain an understanding and appreciation of how easy the job of a vocalist can be when these tools are used, you will also learn that your first lesson in simple performance and placement is still the most potent skill in your art of vocal production arsenal.Graded: More Tools of the TradeGraded: Vocal Technology in the Field\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Coursera", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/coursera"}, "university": {"text": "Berklee College of Music", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/berklee-college-music"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Prince Charles Alexander", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/prince-charles-alexander"}], "category": {"text": "Music, Film & Audio", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/music-film-audio"}, "country": {"text": "USA", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/usa"}, "duration": {"text": "4 Weeks", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/4-weeks"}, "frequency": {"text": "3-5 hours/week", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/3-5-hoursweek"}, "exam": {"text": "Yes, Free Exam and/or Final Project", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/yes-free-exam-andor-final-project"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Verified Certificate (Paid)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-verified-certificate-paid"}, "language": {"text": "English", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/english"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/financial-markets-coursera", "title": "Financial Markets (Coursera)", "description": "STARTS\nProfessor Robert Shiller, 2013 Nobel Prize winner in Economic Sciences, explores the topic of Financial Markets in this eight module course.\nSyllabusWeek 1: Basic Principles of Finance and Risk ManagementWeek 2: Efficient Markets versus Behavioural FinanceWeek 3: Debt versus EquityWeek 4: Real Estate, Regulation and EnterpriseWeek 5: Forward Futures and Options MarketsWeek 6: Monetary PolicyWeek 7: Critical Elements of the Financial InfrastructureWeek 8: Finance and the Broader Public Purpose\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Coursera", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/coursera"}, "university": {"text": "Yale University", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/yale-university"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Bob Shiller", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/bob-shiller"}], "category": {"text": "Management & Leadership", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/management-leadership"}, "country": {"text": "USA", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/usa"}, "duration": {"text": "8 Weeks", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/8-weeks"}, "frequency": {"text": "6-12 hours/week", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/6-12-hoursweek"}, "exam": {"text": "Yes Exam and/or Final Project", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/yes-exam-andor-final-project"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Verified Certificate (Paid)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-verified-certificate-paid"}, "language": {"text": "English", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/english"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/psychology-thrill-seekers-coursera", "title": "The Psychology of Thrill Seekers (Coursera)", "description": "STARTS\nSensation seeking is a trait we all have and includes the search for complex and new experiences.

This MOOC will equip participants with the knowledge to go back to their local governments and make a difference.\nThe world is urbanizing fast. In less than a century more than 1 billion people have been urbanized. That translates into the fact that more than half of the world\u2019s population is already living in cities. Experts forecast that very soon Africa will become one of the most urbanized continents. However, almost 70% of world\u2019s urban population is living in the cities where governments are struggling to provide basic services like sanitation, schools, hospitals, and adequate clean water.\nThe reason is that, their governments do not have enough money. This may also be true also for the city where you live or work. Poor infrastructure affects your daily life.

We take a case-based approach to teach contemporary mathematical modeling techniques. The course is appropriate for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students. Lectures provide biological background and describe the development of both classical mathematical models and more recent representations of biological processes. The course will be useful for students who plan to use experimental techniques as their approach in the laboratory and employ computational modeling as a tool to draw deeper understanding of experiments.\nThe course should also be valuable as an introductory overview for students planning to conduct original research in modeling biological systems.This course focuses on dynamical modeling techniques used in Systems Biology research. These techniques are based on biological mechanisms, and simulations with these models generate predictions that can subsequently be tested experimentally. These testable predictions frequently provide novel insight into biological processes. The approaches taught here can be grouped into the following categories: 1) ordinary differential equation-based models, 2) partial differential equation-based models, and 3) stochastic models.Dynamical Modeling Methods for Systems Biology is course 4 of 6 in the Systems Biology and Biotechnology Specialisation.Design systems-level experiments using appropriate cutting edge techniques, collect big data, and analyze and interpret small and big data sets quantitatively. The Systems Biology Specialization covers the concepts and methodologies used in systems-level analysis of biomedical systems. Successful participants will learn how to use experimental, computational and mathematical methods in systems biology and how to design practical systems-level frameworks to address questions in a variety of biomedical fields. In the final Capstone Project, students will apply the methods they learned in five courses of specialization to work on a research project.\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Coursera", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/coursera"}, "university": {"text": "Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/icahn-school-medicine-mount-sinai"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Eric Sobie", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/eric-sobie"}], "category": {"text": "Sci: Biology & Life Sciences", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/sci-biology-life-sciences"}, "country": {"text": "USA", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/usa"}, "duration": {"text": "7 Weeks", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/7-weeks"}, "frequency": {"text": "8-10 hours/week", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/8-10-hoursweek"}, "exam": {"text": "Yes, Paid Exam and/or Final Project", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/yes-paid-exam-andor-final-project"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Verified Certificate (Paid)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-verified-certificate-paid"}, "language": {"text": "English", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/english"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/blues-understanding-and-performing-american-art-form-coursera", "title": "The Blues: Understanding and Performing an American Art Form (Coursera)", "description": "STARTS\nThe blues is an American art form and the most important musical form in jazz. Although there are other formal paradigms of the blues, such as 8-bar or 16-bar, this course focuses on different incarnations of the 12-bar blues. There are considerable differences between Early Jazz blues, Swing blues, Bebop blues, Modal blues, and Post Bop blues. Each type has its unique harmonic syntax, melodic vocabulary and, associated with them, improvisational techniques. While other aspects of jazz performance practice have been constantly changing from one stylistic convention to another, the blues has never lost its identity and expressive power, and continues to exert a powerful influence on the harmonic and melodic syntax of jazz.\nThis seven-week course explores important aspects of the blues, blues improvisation, basic keyboard textures, jazz harmonic and melodic syntax. Topics include: (1) Blues Progressions; (2) Blues and Other Scales; (3) Improvisational Tools, and others. This course will also cover valuable theoretical concepts enabling the student to master the art of jazz improvisation. Each topic will be introduced from a practical perspective with the clearly stated goal: to improve one\u2019s improvisational skills. Jazz improvisation is rooted in spontaneity, creativity, self-expression and, at the same time, self-control and order. A unique pedagogical approach based on a one-to-one musical interaction conducted with different instrumentalists will help to reinforce many of the concepts introduced in this course and realize its stated objectives.\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Coursera", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/coursera"}, "university": {"text": "University of Rochester", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/university-rochester"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Dariusz Terefenko", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/dariusz-terefenko"}], "category": {"text": "Art, Architecture & Design", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/art-architecture-design"}, "country": {"text": "USA", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/usa"}, "duration": {"text": "7 Weeks", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/7-weeks"}, "frequency": {"text": "1-2 hours/week", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/1-2-hoursweek"}, "exam": {"text": "Yes, Paid Exam and/or Final Project", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/yes-paid-exam-andor-final-project"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Verified Certificate (Paid)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-verified-certificate-paid"}, "language": {"text": "English", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/english"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/information-security-context-and-introduction-coursera", "title": "Information Security: Context and Introduction (Coursera)", "description": "STARTS\nIn this course you will explore information security through some introductory material and gain an appreciation of the scope and context around the subject.

Most of our best and worst experiences in life\u2014both professional and personal\u2014happen in groups with other people. In virtually every area of our lives, we have the opportunity (or the requirement) to connect with other people to accomplish some sort of collective outcome that could not be achieved individually.\nThe success or failure of these outcomes usually depends on the interaction of the group\u2014how people communicate with each other and make decisions. Therefore, to succeed in our careers and to be good citizens in our society we must be able to work with other people in groups and understand group interaction. Accordingly, this course focuses on the key dynamics of group communication, including group development, decision making, conflict and negotiation, difference and diversity, and technology and innovation\u2026all of which are related to our underlying assumptions about communication and our understanding of human interaction. Our goal is to help you learn these important dynamics of group communication, and put them into practice to improve your overall group work.\nWho is this class for: This course is intended for people who currently work in groups (or expect group work to be an important part of their future), who want to improve their group communication skills, and who want a better overall understanding of the phenomenon of group work.\nWEEK 1Module 1Module 1 is all about communication. But not the common sense or taken-for-granted notions of communication you might expect. Instead, we\u2019re going to rethink communication and challenge some of the conventional wisdom about communication that is common in our society. We\u2019ll compare and contrast different theories or models of communication, and see if we can develop a more sophisticated understanding of communication to understand the complexities of human interaction in today\u2019s groups. We\u2019ll also explore some of the hidden forces of group communication, like context, systems and institutions, and design. These are all things that are \u201cpresent\u201d in any group situation, influencing how we interact with each other, but easy to miss if we\u2019re not looking. We want to expand our field of vision, so to speak, so we have a fuller understanding of what\u2019s happening in any group situation.Graded: Week 1 Quiz\nWEEK 2Module 2Module 2 focuses on group development and decision making. We\u2019ll look at how groups come together through socialization, how they develop norms, and how roles emerge. And we\u2019ll compare and contrast different models that explain these processes. We\u2019ll examine the various decision making traps that groups can fall into, while also developing better practices for making good group decisions. And we\u2019ll explore how groups can be more creative and innovative in their decision making.Graded: Week 2 QuizGraded: Application Assignment: Movie Analysis\nWEEK 3Module 3Module 3 is all about conflict, difference, and diversity. We\u2019ll learn how groups can have a good fight and how you can choose the right words in a dispute\u2026as well as how to negotiate with others when things get difficult. We\u2019ll also explore why difference and diversity are so important for group communication, and how understanding the concept of identity is critical for our involvement in groups. And we\u2019ll pay special attention to communication and gender, one of the most significant aspects of difference and diversity for groups to understand.Graded: Week 3 Quiz\nWEEK 4Module 4Module 4 covers group communication and technology\u2026an increasingly prevalent aspect of the modern landscape of group work we must understand. We\u2019ll look at the concept of virtual work and how groups are using technology, as well as various models and theories of media functionality and information processing. We\u2019ll cover several practical and conceptual issues we should always keep in mind when it comes to technology and group communication, and we\u2019ll explore some cutting-edge thinking about technology and group work through the fascinating theory of sociomateriality.Graded: Week 4 QuizGraded: Case Study Creation\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Coursera", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/coursera"}, "university": {"text": "University of Colorado Boulder", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/university-colorado-boulder"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Matthew A.

This course will explore greening the economy on four levels \u2013 individual, business, city, and nation. We will look at the relationships between these levels and give many practical examples of the complexities and solutions across the levels.\nScandinavia, a pioneering place advancing sustainability and combating climate change, is a unique starting point for learning about greening the economy. We will learn from many initiatives attempted in Scandinavia since the 1970s, which are all potentially helpful and useful for other countries and contexts.The International Institute for Industrial Environmental Economics (IIIEE) at Lund University is an international centre of excellence on strategies for sustainable solutions. The IIIEE is ideally suited to understand and explain the interdisciplinary issues in green economies utilising the diverse disciplinary backgrounds of its international staff. The IIIEE has been researching and teaching on sustainability and greener economies since the 1990s and it has extensive international networks connecting with a variety of organizations.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nWEEK 1Introduction: what is a green economy and why is it important?We start the course by looking at the key issues that a green economy seeks to address and the underlying concepts and definitions of a greener economy. In this module, we will describe problems arising from the interaction of the economy and the environment; we will state some of the aims of greening the economy and look into the multitude of definitions; we will use tools to measure and assess a green economy; and we will discuss concepts and indicators related to the green economy.Graded: Introduction\nWEEK 2Individual choicesHere in Module 2 we look at the individual level and how individual choices can help or hinder progress towards a green economy. This module offers an increased understanding of patterns and levels of consumption; we will look at the drivers and theories of consumer behaviour and the limitations of working with consumer choice in isolation (e.g. rebound effect); and develop an understanding of how to measure the impact of consumption (e.g. carbon footprint).Graded: Greener ProductGraded: Individual Choices\nWEEK 3Business strategiesIn the third module, we look at the business level, focusing on how companies and organisations choose strategies that can help transitions to a green economy. In this module, the aim is to understand the changes relevant to the business level for a greener economy. You will be presented to some solutions and concepts that companies use to deal with complex problems encountered in their sustainability work. We will discuss the challenges facing companies that want to take a lead in the transition to a greener economy, and reflect on strategies for green business in different contexts.Graded: Greener BusinessGraded: Business Strategies\nWEEK 4Sustainable citiesIn Module 4, we look at how planning and designing cities can help achieve a green economy and underpin sustainable development. The aim this week is to understand the role of cities for experimentation, planning, collaboration and providing visions for a greener economy. We will use tools to measure and critically assess green economy indicators at the city level and discuss whether city level policies and actions in Scandinavia can work around the world.Graded: Greener CityGraded: Sustainable Cities\nWEEK 5National policiesFinally, in the fifth module, we look at how national governments can establish policies to promote green economy across the different levels (individual, business, city, national) discussed in this course. In this module, we discuss how national level policies affect cities, business, and individuals, as well as the challenges for national level policies to influence other levels, including the international sphere. Finally, we will discuss whether national policies from Scandinavia can work in other contexts.Graded: National Policies\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Coursera", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/coursera"}, "university": {"text": "Lund University", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/lund-university"}, "instructors": [{"text": "H\u00e5kan Rodhe", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/h%C3%A5kan-rodhe"}, {"text": "Kes McCormick", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/kes-mccormick"}, {"text": "Lena Neij", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/lena-neij"}, {"text": "Luis Mundaca", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/luis-mundaca"}, {"text": "Oksana Mont", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/oksana-mont"}, {"text": "Thomas Lindhqvist", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/thomas-lindhqvist"}], "category": {"text": "Sci: Environment", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/sci-environment"}, "country": {"text": "Sweden", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/sweden"}, "duration": {"text": "5 Weeks", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/5-weeks"}, "frequency": {"text": "5-8 hours/week", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/5-8-hoursweek"}, "exam": {"text": "No Exam and/or Final Project information", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/no-exam-andor-final-project-information"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Verified Certificate (Paid)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-verified-certificate-paid"}, "language": {"text": "English", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/english"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/initiation-la-theorie-des-distributions-coursera", "title": "Initiation \u00e0 la th\u00e9orie des distributions (Coursera)", "description": "STARTS\nUne fonction discontinue peut-elle \u00eatre solution d'une \u00e9quation diff\u00e9rentielle?

Following the first one which introduces our subject, the modules 2 (nuclear physics) and 3 (accelerators and detectors) are rather self contained and can be studied separately. The modules 4 to 6 go into more depth about matter and forces as described by the standard model of particle physics. Module 7 deals with our ways to search for new phenomena. And the last module introduces you to two mysterious components of the Universe, namely Dark Matter and Dark Energy.\nWho is this class for: This course is aimed at people who have a basic education in physics, especially classical mechanics and electrodynamics. Basic notions of special relativity and quantum mechanics may also be useful, although we give short reminders of these tools. The ideal background would be that of a 3rd year student in any scientific discipline.\nSyllabusWEEK 1Matter and forces, measuring and countingDuring this first module, we will give an overview of the objects studied in particle physics, namely matter, forces and space-time. We will discuss how one characterizes the strength of an interaction between particles using the concept of cross section, which is central to our subject. At the end of this module, we will visit the laboratory of the nuclear physics course at University of Geneva to see an example of how one measures the strength of a reaction in practice.Graded: Graded quiz for Module 1WEEK 2Nuclear physicsDuring this second module, we deal with nuclear physics and its applications. This is a rather self-contained module. If your main interest is nuclear physics, you will be well served. You will notice that this is a rather substantial module, we recommend that you take two weeks to digest it. At the end of this module, we will visit the Tokamak of the Swiss Institute of Technology in Lausanne and the Beznau nuclear power plant, the oldest one still in operation. This will alllow you to better understand the applications of nuclear physics for our energy supply.Graded: Graded quiz for Module 2WEEK 3Accelerators and detectorsIn this module, we treat the basic facts about particle acceleration and detection. This is a rather self-contained module. If your main interest is particle acceleration and detection, you will be well served. You will notice that this is rather substantial module, we recommend that you take two weeks to digest it. We introduce electromagnetic acceleration and focalisation of particle beams and show how they are used in the accelerator complex of CERN. We describe how charged particles and photons interact with matter and how these interactions are used to detect particles and measure their properties. And we show how modern particle detectors use the synergies between different detection methods to get exhaustive information about the final state of particle collisions.Graded: Graded quiz for Module 3WEEK 4Electromagnetic interactionsWe now start a series of three modules discussing the three fundamental forces described by the Standard Model of particle physics. In this forth module, we go into more details about the properties of electromagnetic interactions. We discuss spin and how it intervenes in measurements. And we give a few examples of basic electromagnetic processes to point out common features. You will notice that the intellectual challenge and also the level of mathematical description rises somewhat as we go along. This is why we first remind you how to describe the intensity of a reaction using the cross section and the decay rate and how to construct a Feynman diagram.Graded: Graded quiz for Module 4WEEK 5Hadrons and strong interactionIn this module we discuss the structure of hadrons and the properties of strong interactions. We start out by explaining how one uses the scattering of electrons off nucleons to learn about the internal structure of these baryons. Step by step we lead you from elastic scattering, through the excitation of resonances, all the way to deep inelastic processes. You thus learn about the concept of form factors and structure functions and what they tell us about hadron structure. We then discuss the physics behind this and learn about color and the strange features of strong interactions, like asymptotic freedom and confinement.Graded: Graded quiz for Module 5WEEK 6Electro-weak interactionsIn this 6th module, we discuss weak interactions and the Higgs mechanism. You will notice that this module is again larger that average. This is due to the rich phenomenology of electro-weak interactions. We recommend that you take 2 weeks to digest the contents. Before entering into our subject, in this first video we go into more depth on the subject of antiparticles. We will then discuss the discrete transformations of charge, space and time reversal. Weak interactions are introduced, explaining the weak charge (called weak isospin) and examples of decays and interactions. Properties of the W and Z bosons are detailed. The extremely tiny cross sections of neutrino interactions with matter are discussed. In the last part of the module, we explain how the Higgs mechanism keeps particles from moving at the speed of light, and the properties of the associated Higgs boson.Graded: Graded quiz for Module 6WEEK 7Discovering new phenomenaIn this 7th module Anna discusses searches for new phenomena, beyond the known ones described by the standard model and covered in previous modules. We will remind you why we believe that the standard model is incomplete and new physics must be added. We will explain how hadron collider data are rendered usable for searches. And we will discuss examples, split into the two categories, based on how new phenomena might manifest themselves.Graded: Graded quiz for Module 7WEEK 8Dark matter and dark energyGraded: Graded quiz for Module 8\nWEEK 1Matter and forces, measuring and countingDuring this first module, we will give an overview of the objects studied in particle physics, namely matter, forces and space-time.

It uses the programming system and language called MATLAB to do so because it is easy to learn, versatile and very useful for engineers and other professionals. MATLAB is a special-purpose language that is an excellent choice for writing moderate-size programs that solve problems involving the manipulation of numbers.\n The design of the language makes it possible to write a powerful program in a few lines. The problems may be relatively complex, while the MATLAB programs that solve them are relatively simple: relative, that is, to the equivalent program written in a general-purpose language, such as C++ or Java. As a result, MATLAB is being used in a wide variety of domains from the natural sciences through all disciplines of engineering to finance and beyond, and it is heavily used in industry. Hence, a solid background in MATLAB is an indispensable skill in today\u2019s job market.Nevertheless, this course is not a MATLAB tutorial.

You will discover the field of \"biodiversity science\", experience the countless forms that biodiversity takes, look at the values and importance of this diversity, understand the processes that create and maintain diversity, and hear about how biodiversity is distributed across the Earth. You will also experience how biodiversity is threatened, and what conservation, management, and individual actions can do for its protection. Having been equipped with such knowledge through the course, we encourage you to take action, however small, to positively influence the future of biodiversity, and thereby become a Biodiversity Ambassador.\nThis course is unique in several respects:- The video lectures are presented by many of the biodiversity scientists at the University of Zurich, with each of them speaking about their own area of expertise, and the general area in which this resides.- It covers topics ranging from quite conceptual to very applied, and from natural to social sciences.- Video lectures vary in their depth and technical content, so there is something to challenge even more advanced learners.- Assessments are designed to test core knowledge.- There are two novel peer assignments, in which you will get feedback from peers about your submission. This will create for you a more interactive experience than otherwise.- The final course module and its peer assignment encourages you to become a \"Biodiversity Ambassador\" -- someone who speaks out on behalf of biodiversity.- We encourage and facilitate building of a community and to pair up with other participants to become active Biodiversity Ambassadors together.\nTOPICS OF THE 8 MODULES OF THIS MOOCModule 1: What is biodiversity? What facets of diversity can we observe?Module 2: How does evolution work? How do you interpret evolutionary trees? How are species described and classified? Why are there sometimes different classifications for a group of organisms?Module 3: Biodiversity in our diets. This includes an exercise in which you will look at the diversity in your diet and classify it.Module 4: Ecological patterns and processes: how do you find out which species are where, what spatial patterns can be observed, remote sensing of functional diversity.Module 5: Why is biodiversity important? Values of biodiversity. Description of the Ecosystem services framework.Module 6: History of life on Earth. The current climate change (\"global warming\"). What is the \"Great Acceleration\"? Global change in general and how it affects amphibians and the Arctic.

It tells the story of key campaigns in US history, and by doing so it explores how politics changed over time\u2014and how understanding the past sheds light on the current campaign.\nThe five elections that we'll investigate are among the most significant in American political history. In 1800, Thomas Jefferson won the presidency in a contest that encouraged politicians to reform the electoral college, the system by which presidents are still chosen. The election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 prompted the outbreak of the Civil War. It's an election that helps us to understand the development of political parties. In 1968, the Vietnam War was a dominant concern for Americans, and yet foreign policy played a secondary role in Richard Nixon's victory. Twelve years later, in 1980, Ronald Reagan won an election that initiated a new era of conservatism. As election day approaches, we'll turn our attention to the 2008 election, which many saw as signaling a turn to progressivism and as revealing the impact of the digital revolution on campaign politics.\nWho is this class for: This course is for everyone who is interested in exploring, against the backdrop of the eventful 2016 campaign, the history of presidential elections in the United States.\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Coursera", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/coursera"}, "university": {"text": "University of Edinburgh", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/university-edinburgh"}, "instructors": [{"text": "David Silkenat", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/david-silkenat"}, {"text": "Fabian Hilfrich", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/fabian-hilfrich"}, {"text": "Frank Cogliano", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/frank-cogliano"}, {"text": "Robert Mason", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/robert-mason"}], "category": {"text": "Humanities", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/humanities"}, "country": {"text": "United Kingdom", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/united-kingdom"}, "duration": {"text": "3 Weeks", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/3-weeks"}, "frequency": {"text": "3-4 hours/week", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/3-4-hoursweek"}, "exam": {"text": "Yes Exam and/or Final Project", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/yes-exam-andor-final-project"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Verified Certificate (Paid)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-verified-certificate-paid"}, "language": {"text": "English", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/english"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/introduction-natural-language-processing-coursera", "title": "Introduction to Natural Language Processing (Coursera)", "description": "STARTS\nThis course provides an introduction to the field of Natural Language Processing.

This will allow us to journey from Predynastic Egypt and its first king, Narmer, to Greco-Roman Egypt and its final queen, Cleopatra.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Coursera", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/coursera"}, "university": {"text": "University of Manchester", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/university-manchester"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Campbell Price", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/campbell-price"}, {"text": "Glenn Godenho", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/glenn-godenho"}, {"text": "Joyce Tyldesley", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/joyce-tyldesley"}], "category": {"text": "Humanities", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/humanities"}, "country": {"text": "United Kingdom", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/united-kingdom"}, "duration": {"text": "6 Weeks", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/6-weeks"}, "frequency": {"text": "2-3 hours/week", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/2-3-hoursweek"}, "exam": {"text": "Yes, Free Exam and/or Final Project", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/yes-free-exam-andor-final-project"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Statement of Accomplishment (Free Certificate)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-statement-accomplishment-free-certificate"}, "language": {"text": "English", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/english"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/mental-health-global-priority-coursera", "title": "Mental Health: A Global Priority (Coursera)", "description": "STARTS\nThis course is designed to help you develop a broader understanding of mental health and illness from a global perspective. Over five weeks you will be guided in exploring how and why the current challenges faced in mental health care vary globally.\nMental illness can affect anyone. It is an important cause of disability worldwide. However the pathways to receiving adequate and humane mental health care vary within countries and between countries. This mental health inequity is a challenge to be explored and overcome in order to attain better health for all nations. Participating in this course is a step towards overcoming this global challenge.The 5-week course begins with an introduction to fundamental concepts related to mental health and illness and presents evidence for global mental health inequity. The course will consider how factors such as stigma, violations of human rights, culture, spirituality, partnerships and technology may affect the pathways to mental health care. We will also consider the effects of globalisation on mental illness and mental health care. The course concludes by looking at the opportunities we have in the 21st century to prioritise and improve mental health from a local and global perspective.\nTo view this video please enable

problems, and intractable problems (NP-completeness).\nI am pleased to be able to offer free over the Internet a course on Automata Theory, based on the material I have taught periodically at Stanford in the course CS154. Students have access to screencast lecture videos, are given quiz questions, assignments and exams, receive regular feedback on progress, and can participate in a discussion forum. Those who successfully complete the course will receive a statement of accomplishment. You will need a decent Internet connection for accessing course materials, but should be able to watch the videos on your smartphone.The course covers four broad areas: (1) Finite automata and regular expressions, (2) Context-free grammars, (3) Turing machines and decidability, and (4) the theory of intractability, or NP-complete problems.Why Study Automata Theory?This subject is not just for those planning to enter the field of complexity theory, although it is a good place to start if that is your goal. Rather, the course will emphasize those aspects of the theory that people really use in practice. Finite automata, regular expressions, and context-free grammars are ideas that have stood the test of time. They are essential tools for compilers. But more importantly, they are used in many systems that require input that is less general than a full programming language yet more complex than \"push this button.\"The concepts of undecidable problems and intractable problems serve a different purpose. Undecidable problems are those for which no computer solution can ever exist, while intractable problems are those for which there is strong evidence that, although they can be solved by a computer, they cannot be solved sufficiently fast that the solution is truly useful in practice. Understanding this theory, and in particular being able to prove that a problem you are facing belongs to one of these classes, allows you to justify taking another approach \u2014 simplifying the problem or writing code to approximate the solution, for example.During the course, I'm going to prove a number of things. The purpose of these proofs is not to torture you or confuse you. Neither are the proofs there because I doubt you would believe me were I merely to state some well-known fact. Rather, understanding how these proofs, especially inductive proofs, work, lets you think more clearly about your own work. I do not advocate proofs that programs are correct, but whenever you attempt something a bit complex, it is good to have in mind the inductive proofs that would be needed to guarantee that what you are doing really works in all cases.\nSuggested Readings:\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Coursera", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/coursera"}, "university":

The Social Science of Wrongful Conviction (Coursera)", "description": "STARTS\nThe United States criminal justice system is typically an accurate and efficient system\u2014although, as a human creation, it is not perfect. This course will employ a social scientific perspective to understand why innocent people are sometimes convicted of crimes they did not commit. In this course we will discuss wrongful convictions, their causes, and their solutions.\nAccording to the National Registry of Exonerations, a joint project of Michigan Law and Northwestern Law, over 1,300 individuals in the United States have been exonerated after being convicted for crimes they did not commit. These are the known cases of wrongful conviction\u2014the actual number is much higher. Some of these individuals have served years, even decades, in prison for these crimes. Often, real offenders have escaped justice as a result of the wrong person being accused and convicted.As noted, we will approach this topic from a social scientific perspective. Social science is a broad field that seeks to understand social interactions between individuals, groups, and institutions. The field includes academic disciplines such as sociology, criminology, psychology, economics, anthropology, political science, and other related disciplines.In this course we will explore wrongful convictions answering several key questions:What do we mean by \u201cwrongfully convicted,\u201d and how common are wrongful convictions?Who are wrongfully convicted?Where in the criminal justice system do things go wrong to lead to wrongful convictions?Why do wrongful convictions occur?How can social science contribute to understanding, and preventing wrongful convictions?\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Coursera", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/coursera"}, "university": {"text": "Pennsylvania State University", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/pennsylvania-state-university"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Tim R Robicheaux", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/tim-r-robicheaux"}], "category": {"text": "Law", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/law"}, "country": {"text": "USA", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/usa"}, "duration": {"text": "This Course is Not Available", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/course-not-available"}, "frequency": {"text": "4-6 hours/week", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/4-6-hoursweek"}, "exam": {"text": "No Exam and/or Final Project information", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/no-exam-andor-final-project-information"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Statement of Accomplishment (Free Certificate)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-statement-accomplishment-free-certificate"}, "language": {"text": "English", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/english"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/mathematical-methods-quantitative-finance-coursera", "title": "Mathematical Methods for Quantitative Finance (Coursera)", "description": "STARTS\nMathematical Methods for Quantitative Finance covers topics from calculus and linear algebra that are fundamental for the study of mathematical finance.

Whether you're an EMS responder, physician, nurse, social worker, health care student, or other health care provider, you will acquire foundational knowledge in preparedness, management, and response for disasters and large-scale public health emergencies in this 6-week course.\nIn this state of the art course we will be discussing personal and hospital-based preparedness for disasters and large-scale public health emergencies. This course will provide students with a heightened awareness and understanding of the natural and man-made hazards that create disaster events. Each topic in the course is presented by a leader and subject matter expert, allowing students to learn from some of the most highly-recognized stakeholders in disaster preparedness. Course content is designed to assist health care providers and students in acquiring cutting-edge, evidence-based disaster knowledge and skills in order to respond in a timely and appropriate manner and ultimately to increase hospital surge capacity.We start by presenting an overview of the foundational concepts underlying disaster preparedness with a focus on understanding individual health care provider roles and responsibilities within our existing emergency response systems as well as for personal and family preparedness. Next, we consider all components of a well-designed hospital preparedness program including redundant communications and situational awareness, the role of the health care provider in disaster operations and logistics, and education and training for workforce development. Finally, we cover the roles and responsibilities of health care providers in response to specific disaster and public health emergency events resulting from acts of terrorism, pandemic influenza and emerging highly infectious disease, chemical, biological and radiological emergencies, and natural disasters.In this six-week course, health care providers will acquire foundational knowledge in the health care management of victims of natural and man-made disasters and new strategies for increasing hospital surge capacity. Utilizing course exercises, case studies, and online discussions, students will have the opportunity to identify strategies and expert practices in the care of victims of disasters and public health emergencies.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Coursera", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/coursera"}, "university": {"text": "Johns Hopkins University", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/johns-hopkins-university"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Tener Goodwin Veenema", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/tener-goodwin-veenema"}], "category": {"text": "Health & Society", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/health-society"}, "country": {"text": "USA", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/usa"}, "duration": {"text": "6 Weeks", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/6-weeks"}, "frequency": {"text": "2-4 hours/week", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/2-4-hoursweek"}, "exam": {"text": "No Exam and/or Final Project information", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/no-exam-andor-final-project-information"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Verified Certificate (Paid)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-verified-certificate-paid"}, "language": {"text": "English", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/english"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/social-entrepreneurship-coursera", "title": "Social Entrepreneurship (Coursera)", "description": "STARTS\nIn this course you will learn how to create societal impact through Social Entrepreneurship (S-ENT). S-ENT describes the discovery and sustainable exploitation of opportunities to create social change. We will introduce you to S-ENT examples and guide you through the process of identifying an opportunity to address social problems as well as outlining your idea in a business plan.\nIn this course we will ask you to form groups with other MOOC participants to identify an opportunity to create social change, develop a business model, and outline ideas in a business plan, which you will in the end submit to possibly receive start-up funding.The domain of social change is no longer reserved for students of political sciences and development studies. Increasingly business graduates are recognized as possessing important skills that can drive social change. This new discipline is often referred to as Social Entrepreneurship (S-ENT). S-ENT describes the discovery and sustainable exploitation of opportunities to create public goods. This is usually done through the generation of disequilibria in market and non-market environments. The S-ENT process can in some cases lead to the creation of social enterprises. These social ventures are hybrid organizations exhibiting characteristics of both the for-profit and not-for-profit sector. Individuals engaging in S-ENT are usually referred to as social entrepreneurs, a term that describes resourceful individuals working to create social innovation. They do not only have to identify (or create) opportunities for social change (that so far have been unexploited), they must also muster the resources necessary to turn these opportunities into reality.A typical example is Prof. Muhammad Yunus, founder of the Grameen Bank (Bangladesh) and recipient of the Nobel Peace prize in recognition of his contribution to poverty alleviation through the invention and popularization of Microfinance. Other examples include fair trade or car-sharing. Today many foundations aim to identify and promote social entrepreneurs. Two prominent examples are Ashoka and the Skoll Foundation. So called venture philanthropists adopt methods from the domain of venture capital, for example, encouraging social entrepreneurs to provide detailed business plans and to measure and report systematically on their social performance. Social Return on Investment (S-ROI) analysis is an example, of an emerging tool aiming to describe the social impact of S-ENT in dollar terms, relative to the philanthropic investment made.As part of the course you will be working in groups on identifying an opportunity for a social innovation or social enterprise. You will then write a business plan outlining the business model for implementing your idea. All business plans will be evaluated at the end of the course and the winners will be supported in the implementation of their idea.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Coursera", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/coursera"}, "university": {"text": "Copenhagen Business School", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/copenhagen-business-school"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Kai Hockerts", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/kai-hockerts"}, {"text": "Kristjan Johannes Suse Jespersen", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/kristjan-johannes-suse-jespersen"}], "category": {"text": "Management & Leadership", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/management-leadership"}, "country": {"text": "Denmark", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/denmark"}, "duration": {"text": "12 Weeks", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/12-weeks"}, "frequency": {"text": "4-6 hours/week", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/4-6-hoursweek"}, "exam": {"text": "No Exam and/or Final Project information", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/no-exam-andor-final-project-information"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Statement of Accomplishment (Free Certificate) or Verified Certificate", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-statement-accomplishment-free-certificate-or-verified-certificate"}, "language": {"text": "English", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/english"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/foundational-neuroscience-perception-and-action-coursera", "title": "Foundational Neuroscience for Perception and Action (Coursera)", "description": "STARTS\nLearn the basic structure and function of the human nervous system, how nerve cells generate electrical signals and communicate, how they reshape their connections with use, and how neural systems integrate external and internal sensory signals to orchestrate action.\nThis course is a shorter version of my medical school-caliber course, Medical Neuroscience. Like its parent course, this shorter course covers the organization and physiology of the human central nervous system. The focus of Foundational Neuroscience for Perception and Action is on the basic components of the brain and spinal cord, the means by which nerve cells generate electrical signals and communicate, the neural mechanisms of synaptic and circuit plasticity, and the organization of the sensory and motor systems that integrate experience and motivate behavior. Unlike its parent course, this shorter course is not so clinically focused. Rather, it aims to explore foundational mechanisms in neuroscience without emphasizing the competency of localizing lesions in the human central nervous system (a major focus of Medical Neuroscience). The overall goal of this course is to equip learners to be successful in our specialization, Perception, Action and the Brain. To help you get the most out of our specialization, this course will teach you the basic neural mechanisms that makes it possible for the human brain to contend with an onslaught of sensory signals and generate successful behavior for survival and flourishing in a complex world. Thus, the other two courses in Perception, Action and the Brain will introduce you to the phenomenology of what we see and the means by which the brain generates visual representations (Visual Perception and the Brain), and challenge you to understand how the brain creates our sense of spatial location from a variety of sensory and motor sources, and how this spatial sense in turn shapes our cognitive abilities (The Brain and Space). The role, then, of Foundational Neuroscience for Perception and Action is to give you a \"look under the hood\" so that you can understand the neural mechanisms that operate at the level of synapses, circuits, and sensorimotor systems. You will then use this intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the human central nervous system as you take on the final project in our specialization. This course is for advanced baccalaureate and prospective or current graduate students who are pursuing degrees in the brain sciences. It is also for students or professionals in technical fields concerned with human factors in computing, virtual reality, or gaming who are interested in understanding how the brain generates perceptions and actions. Teachers who are interested in understanding how the brain works as a means to enhance their curriculum in science education, or just to enhance student learning more generally will benefit. As will anyone who is simply curious about how the brain contends with sensory information and produces action.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nSuggested Readings:Neuroscience, Fifth Edition\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Coursera", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/coursera"}, "university": {"text": "Duke University", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/duke-university"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Leonard E.

Professor Ariel Hirschfeld will discuss the poetic revolution that took place in Hebrew culture at the end of the 19th Century, and specifically the poetry of Bialik and Shaul Tchernichovsky, who both radically changed the way the cultural agenda of Judaism was associated with the Hebrew language. We will therefore follow the development of the Hebrew literary community until the Second World War, extending over three continents. The course describes the dramatic dynamics that occurred within Israeli literary society around the nature of Hebrew poetry and its extraordinary poetic achievements, which is, without doubt, one of the most impressive poetic cultures in the modern world.Modern Hebrew Poetry is an open, free online course, and all learners are welcome. This course is being taken by Hebrew University students for credit at the University. If you are a learner interested in earning academic credit but are not enrolled at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, there is a way you can potentially receive credit from the Hebrew University. Please remember there is no requirement for you to pay additional cost to earn credit if you are interested in just signing up to earn a Verified certificate through Signature Track, or if you simply want to take the course for free.OPTIONS FOR TAKING THE COURSE:1.

It's not about \"work/life balance\"; it's about creating harmony among the different parts of your life as a leader in all of them.\nLife is a zero-sum game, right? The more you strive to win in one dimension (such as your work or school), the more you have to sacrifice in the other dimensions (family, community, and the private self).

Nor should you! A trade-off mindset makes people feel all manner of stress \u2013 unfocused, resentful, and overwhelmed. It hurts those you care about and prevents you from performing effectively to produce results that matter in every part of your life.In this course you learn how to articulate your values and personal leadership vision, cultivate supportive relationships with people who matter most in all parts of your life, and continually experiment with how you get things done to better align your actions with your values -- and so produce positive sustainable change.

Why should we have a State? What kind of State should we have?Even within a political community, there may be sharp disagreements about the role and purpose of government. Some want an active, involved government, seeing legal and political institutions as the means to solve our most pressing problems, and to help bring about peace, equality, justice, happiness, and to protect individual liberty. Others want a more minimal government, motivated, perhaps, by some of the disastrous political experiments of the 20th Century, and the thought that political power is often just a step away from tyranny. In many cases, these disagreements arise out of deep philosophical disagreements.All political and legal institutions are built on foundational ideas. In this course, we will explore those ideas, taking the political institutions and political systems around us not as fixed and unquestionable, but as things to evaluate and, if necessary, to change.

Its main purpose is to expose students to the future of how mathematicians see this profession, and thus prepare them to study mathematics at university.\nLearning mathematics at university is fundamentally different than learning mathematics at high school. This difference has many manifestations: at high school most of the learning focuses on the development of technical skills, and the tendency is to draw a clear separation between the various areas of mathematics. In contrast, the mathematics taught at university level deals to a large extent with mathematical structures and their interconnections.This course is a \"display window\" of the mathematics that is being taught and studied at the university. Its main goal is to prepare would-be-students toward the mathematics that they will encounter, whether they choose to learn this subject, or any discipline that uses mathematics as its main language and tool (e.g., physics, computer science, and engineering).Most of the mathematical content covered in this course is part of the high school curriculum. The difference is in the approach. In these lectures we will emphasize central mathematical concepts (e.g. the need to define ambiguous terms, and the principle of mathematical deduction).

The course emphasizes the ways our evolution touches our lives, including health and diet, and explores how deep history may shape the future of our species.\nThis course covers our evolutionary history across more than seven million years, from our origins among the apes up to the biological changes that are still unfolding today. If you enroll, you'll encounter the evidence for the earliest members of our lineage, as they begin the long pathway to humanity. You'll see how scientists are learning about the diets of ancient people, using microscopic evidence and chemical signatures in ancient teeth. We will explore together the exciting fossil discoveries of the last ten years, which have shaken up our notions of the origin of human culture and our own genus.\nGenomics has fundamentally transformed the way we understand our evolution, in many ways opening the direct evidence of our history to anyone. The course will teach you how to look inside the genomes of humans, Neandertals and other ancient people. If you have used personal genomics to get your own genotypes, the course will guide you in connecting genetics to your ancestry among ancient humans.\nThe course brings a special focus on the rapid evolutionary changes of the last 10,000 years. You'll learn about the consequences of our shift to agriculture, and the ways that people of industrialized nations are still changing today. At the end, we trek forward to anticipate what evolutionary changes may be in store for humanity in the future, using our knowledge of history and scientific understanding to inform our speculations.\nMore info: https://www.coursera.org/course/humanevolution\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Coursera", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/coursera"}, "university": {"text": "University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/university-wisconsin%E2%80%93madison"}, "instructors": [{"text": "John Hawks", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/john-hawks"}], "category": {"text": "Sci: Biology & Life Sciences", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/sci-biology-life-sciences"}, "country": {"text": "USA", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/usa"}, "duration": {"text": "10 Weeks", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/10-weeks"}, "frequency": {"text": "5-7 hours/week", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/5-7-hoursweek"}, "exam": {"text": "No Exam and/or Final Project information", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/no-exam-andor-final-project-information"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Statement of Accomplishment (Free Certificate)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-statement-accomplishment-free-certificate"}, "language": {"text": "English", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/english"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/unpredictable-randomness-chance-and-free-will-coursera", "title": "Unpredictable?

We seek to do so as a community of learning committed not only to the curricular objectives for our course, but seeking to demonstrate to the world how to conduct informed and respectful discourse on subjects which have plenty of room for disagreement.\nSuggested Readings:\nMore info: https://www.coursera.org/course/afp21stcentury\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Coursera", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/coursera"}, "university": {"text": "Duke University", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/duke-university"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Bruce W Jentleson", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/bruce-w-jentleson"}], "category": {"text": "Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/social-sciences"}, "country": {"text": "USA", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/usa"}, "duration": {"text": "6 Weeks", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/6-weeks"}, "frequency": {"text": "4-6 hours/week", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/4-6-hoursweek"}, "exam": {"text": "No Exam and/or Final Project information", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/no-exam-andor-final-project-information"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Statement of Accomplishment (Free Certificate)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-statement-accomplishment-free-certificate"}, "language": {"text": "English", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/english"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/statistics-one-coursera", "title": "Statistics One (Coursera)", "description": "STARTS\nStatistics One is a comprehensive yet friendly introduction to statistics.\nStatistics One is designed to be a comprehensive yet friendly introduction to fundamental concepts in statistics.

Enrolling in the RESPONSEABLE MOOC you will be able to explore answers to these and other questions, guided by a multidisciplinary team which includes marine biologists, ecologists, economists, social scientists, communication experts and ocean literacy experts.\nProtecting our oceans: moving from knowledge to behavioral change\nWorld oceans cover more than 72% of the planet surface. But as citizens, local authorities, economic sectors and civil society, what do we know about the oceans, the state of their ecosystems or the services they deliver to society? Do we (individually and collectively) know enough for us to act responsibly, so the pressures on marine ecosystems are reduced and opportunities offered by the oceans duly seized?\nEvidence suggests that knowledge is not sufficient to promote widespread behavioural change. A first barrier might reside in the fact that this knowledge, although available, is currently scattered and not sufficiently structured and organized. As a second challenge, it might be difficult for the public and other economic actors to understand a complex system such as the ocean. Thirdly, knowledge might not be effectively conveyed to citizens and to the specific actors involved in the ocean-human interactions. And this is where ocean literacy comes into place.This MOOC explores effective ways to move from knowledge to behavioral change through ocean literacy. In particular, during the course we will look for answers to the following questions:What do we know about the human-ocean relationships?Which opportunities for changing behavior of sea-connected socio-economic actors?How do (ocean) knowledge systems function?How can we establish conditions that enable individuals or organised groups to develop their knowledge and potential, so they can take their role and responsibility in society?The course is offered by ResponSEAble, a research project supported by the Horizon 2020 Programme of the European Commission.

Then, the course continues with operational considerations, on e.g. supply chain management issues, different types of planning problems that are encountered, and the development of decision support for the design and operations of biobased supply chains.Don\u2019t miss out on this opportunity to gain the skills on a strategic- and operational level to transform your company\u2019s business model in a conscious, sustainable and profitable one.\nWhat you'll learn- Understand the dynamics in biobased business investments- Creating business strategies in a biobased economy- Understand the supply chain challenges for biobased businesses- Design and evaluate biobased supply chains using quantitative methods\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "EdX", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/edx"}, "university": {"text": "Wageningen University", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/wageningen-university"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Argyris Kanellopoulos", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/argyris-kanellopoulos"}, {"text": "Dmytro Krushynskyi", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/dmytro-krushynskyi"}, {"text": "Emiel Wubben", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/emiel-wubben"}, {"text": "Jacqueline Bloemhof", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/jacqueline-bloemhof"}, {"text": "Jos Bijman", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/jos-bijman"}, {"text": "Renzo Akkerman", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/renzo-akkerman"}], "category": {"text": "Business", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/business"}, "country": {"text": "Netherlands", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/netherlands"}, "duration": {"text": "6 Weeks", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/6-weeks"}, "frequency": {"text": "12-16 hours/week", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/12-16-hoursweek"}, "exam": {"text": "Yes Exam and/or Final Project", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/yes-exam-andor-final-project"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Verified Certificate (Paid)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-verified-certificate-paid"}, "language": {"text": "English", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/english"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/conscious-mind-philosophical-road-trip-edx", "title": "The Conscious Mind - A Philosophical Road Trip (edX)", "description": "STARTS\nExplore the worlds of sense, thought and the mind, as revealed through the philosophical discipline of phenomenology. In ordinary life we barely notice the operations of our own minds. In The Conscious Mind - A Philosophical Road Trip, we will illuminate what we take for granted in perception, action, and interaction with others. We\u2019ll explore this mindful awareness through demonstrations, illusions, brainteasers, thought experiments, riddles and jokes, all designed to shake you loose from your ordinary assumptions about the way consciousness works.\nYou will explore your own mind and the minds of others in a new way, using a philosophical approach known as phenomenology. You\u2019ll encounter some of the main ideas of the phenomenological tradition, through short readings by Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. Their ideas are provocative and will animate the online and offline conversation as we proceed. But the main approach of the course will be experiential and experimental.

Are you aware of the controversial situations facing States and foreign investors nowadays in relation to, for instance, the protection of public health and the environment? Do you recall recent cases such as Philip Morris v Uruguay and Vattenfall v Germany?\nIn the aftermath of these high profile cases and in the context of the negotiation of new international investment agreements, like the CETA and the TPP, local populations, policy-makers and NGOs have come to realize the societal importance of international investment law. Passionate and sometimes ill-informed discussions have resulted from this realisation. They have focused on the features of international investment law, which has traditionally granted rights to foreign investors to foster States\u2019 economic development. Central to these discussions are the issues of:- the balance between the protection of foreign investors and the right of host States to regulate in order to protect public welfare objectives;- the duties and obligations of foreign investors;- the promotion of sustainable development in international investment law;- the legitimacy of arbitration tribunals to decide on disputes between host States and foreign investors;- the coherence of arbitration practice.Learning and understanding the features and dynamics of international investment law is key not only for international lawyers and policy-makers, but it is also important knowledge for all well-informed citizens.In this law course, you will:- discover the history of international investment law and understand the dynamics which shape its evolution;- learn the objectives of international investment law and the specific rights international investment agreements grant to foreign investors;- discover how those rights have been interpreted by arbitration tribunals;- master the features and functions of investor-state arbitration;- understand why international investment law and investor-state arbitration are currently the subject of criticism and be able to assess the soundness of this criticism;- gain insight into the content of treaties newly concluded, and be able to assess how they address the issues of the right of host States to regulate, of foreign investors\u2019 obligations and of the legitimacy of arbitration tribunals.\nWhat you'll learnAt the end of this course, you\u2019ll be able to:- relate the history and evolution of international investment law and comment on current controversies and criticisms;- analyse the law and practice of international investment law;- understand the functioning of investment arbitration.\nPrerequisites- Knowledge of the fundamentals of International Law (subjects and sources of International Law/ principles governing international responsibility).

In this course, you will discover precisely what Borges meant.\nLearning to read poetry is learning to do the deep magic of language. It's learning to speak to the dead. At first the book just sits there silent as the grave, but if we listen carefully then, softly at first, the poetry begins to speak to us and we find ourselves speaking to it in response. Dante is the master of speaking with the dead. He convinces us that the dead can tell us things we do not know\u2014things we cannot discover about the meaning of life because we are still in the middle of it. He shows us that conversations with the dead can change the way that we look at life. You and I may not have enough imagination to explore the realms of death that open up in the middle of life, and Dante knows that no one can find their way through life without a guide. This course will help you discover the magic of Dante's poetry and Dante will teach you to imagine the deepest terrors and the highest hopes that are still undiscovered in your heart. Only then will you be in a position to decide finally, for yourself, who you choose to become.In this course, you will begin to question for yourself the meaning of human freedom, responsibility and identity by reading and responding to Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. The Comedy, which is richly steeped in the medieval culture of 14th century, still speaks vividly to modern readers struggling with the questions \u201cwho am I?\u201d and \u201cwhat meaning or value can my life have?\u201d Dante struggled with the same questions before coming to a moment of vision that wholly transformed him as a person.This course is presented to you through the MyDante platform, an online environment developed by Professor Frank Ambrosio in collaboration with the Georgetown University Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship (CNDLS).

You can also benefit from human rights knowledge in a voluntary capacity, advocating social justice, peace or building a sustainable future.This course is part of the CurtinX Human Rights MicroMasters program.\nWhat you'll learnOn successful completion of this course you will be able to:- describe and critique human rights theories and philosophies- critically analyse political, policy and moral issues using a human rights framework\nWeek 1: What do we mean by human rights?Week 2: Modern perspectives on human rightsWeek 3: Constructing human rights: The Universal Declaration of Human RightsWeek 4: Human rights and the cultural relativist and postmodern critiquesWeek 5: Human rights and the postcolonial and decolonial critiquesWeek 6: Human rights beyond western perspectivesWeek 7: Indigenous rightsWeek 8: Human rights and the feminist critiquesWeek 9: Sexual Orientation, gender identity and human rightsWeek 10: Disability and human rightsWeek 11: Human rights and seeking asylumWeek 12: Human rights, the environment and the Anthropocene\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "EdX", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/edx"}, "university": {"text": "Curtin University", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/curtin-university"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Caroline Fleay", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/caroline-fleay"}], "category": {"text": "Humanities", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/humanities"}, "country": {"text": "Australia", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/australia"}, "duration": {"text": "12 Weeks", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/12-weeks"}, "frequency": {"text": "8-10 hours/week", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/8-10-hoursweek"}, "exam": {"text": "Yes Exam and/or Final Project", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/yes-exam-andor-final-project"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Verified Certificate (Paid)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-verified-certificate-paid"}, "language": {"text": "English", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/english"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/human-rights-activism-advocacy-and-change-edx", "title": "Human Rights Activism, Advocacy and Change (edX)", "description": "STARTS\nLearn about the role of social movements, advocacy groups and activism in bringing about social change.

In the Universe, high-energy cosmic rays are violently propagating in space. While we know these cosmic rays come from outside of the solar system, exactly how and where they originate is a mystery. Professor Shoji Torii from Waseda University and many researchers from around the world, believe that understanding about their origin will help resolve the mysteries of the Universe, such as, supernova remnants, dark matter, and even the Universe\u2019s evolution.\nThe most widely accepted theory is that high-energy cosmic rays are created by supernova explosions, but there are many other possibilities. Professor Torii hypothesis that these mysterious cosmic rays originate by the annihilation or decay of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPS). That is, they originate from dark matter.\nTo examine this theory and to truly understand where high-energy cosmic rays originate and propagate, Professor Torii, along with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and in collaboration with NASA and the Italian space Agency (ASI) have developed the Calorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET), now onboard the international space station.Join us on this course on high-energy cosmic rays and get the latest research findings from the International Space Station to help unravel some of our greatest mysteries.\nWhat you'll learn- The evolution of the universe- The origin and propagation of cosmic rays- The search for dark matter through cosmic ray observation\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "EdX", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/edx"}, "university": {"text": "Waseda University", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/waseda-university"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Shoji Torii", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/shoji-torii"}], "category": {"text": "Sci: Physics", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/sci-physics"}, "country": {"text": "Japan", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/japan"}, "duration": {"text": "4 Weeks", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/4-weeks"}, "frequency": {"text": "3-5 hours/week", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/3-5-hoursweek"}, "exam": {"text": "Yes Exam and/or Final Project", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/yes-exam-andor-final-project"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Verified Certificate (Paid)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-verified-certificate-paid"}, "language": {"text": "English", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/english"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/introduction-solar-systems-astronomy-edx", "title": "Introduction to Solar Systems Astronomy (edX)", "description": "STARTS\nExplore the exciting world of modern solar systems astronomy in this credit-eligible course.

Explore alternative theories and innovative solutions for urban challenges in the global south. You\u2019ll learn about today\u2019s urban challenges focusing on developing countries, referred to as the global south.\nWe will debate the benefits of three pathways, going beyond traditional urban strategies and policies:1. Spatial justiceSpatial justice is undoubtedly one of the greatest challenges of urban contexts in emerging economies.2. Housing Provision and ManagementIncreasing demand in the global south calls for alternative approaches in housing provision and management.3. Urban ResilienceUnderstanding resilience not as a mere struggle for survival, but as an opportunity to build better urban environments.\nWe will discuss question such as:- Is the just city framework applicable in cities with extreme socio-economic inequality?- Can community-led housing initiatives provide effective solutions for households in need?- How can resilience support development instead of perpetuating a disadvantaged condition?In this architecture and urban planning course, academic urban planning expertise from TU Delft is used to formulate possible answers to these questions, and is applied in a range of challenging case studies from Ghana, Brazil, Malaysia, Chile, and China, among others. This course offers you a new perspective to understand and analyze the urban challenges of the global south.Through a combination of short theoretical lessons, presentation of case studies, testimonies from practitioners and practical assignments you will also learn how to develop a critical perspective about your own urban environment and how to translate this knowledge into analytical tools and innovative urban solutions.This course is designed for undergraduate and master level students of architecture, urban planning and disciplines related to urban themes. Nevertheless, anyone interested on debating spatial justice, urban resilience and housing provision and management are welcome.No previous knowledge in urban planning or global south is required, just your eagerness to learn!\nRETHINK THE CITY PRIZEOne participant will be selected to come to Delft to participate in the 2017 Summer School \u201cPlanning and Design with Water\u201d. This Rethink the City prize will cover the costs of the tuition fee for the summer school, the costs of board and lodging in Delft during the period of the summer school, and the travel costs to The Netherlands. The selection criteria for this prize will be communicated upon the course start.\nWhat you'll learn- Alternative theories in spatial justice, housing provision and management, and urban resilience.- Application of analytical tools and innovative solutions to contemporary urban challenges- Develop a critical perspective about your own urban environment.- New perspectives to understand and analyze the urban challenges of the global south.\nThis course is an instructor-paced course, structured in three modules. During the seven weeks, students can explore the different modules according to their own plan. The course is then structured as follows:\nWeek 1: IntroductionGeneral introduction and course structure. Plan your course and your \u2018critical thinking\u2019 assignment, where you will have to upload a picture identifying the urban challenge you think it is most important to your city.\nWeek 2 to week 4: ModulesThe three modules are presented following the same steps:First: Introducing the theory by providing a contemporary perspective of the urban topic and main concepts.Second: Applying the theory by presenting three case studies.Third: Challenging the theory by presenting the experience of a practitioner in each field.The three modules are:1. Spatial Justice. This is undoubtedly one of the greatest challenges for cities in emerging economies. Spatial Justice is a relatively new area of study that focuses on mainly two \u2018types\u2019 of justice: distributive justice and procedural justice. On one hand, justice is sought through the fair allocation of resources and services throughout the urban territory. On the other hand, justice or injustice can also be found in the planning and design procedures, laws and regulations of a city. This part of the course aims to analyze concrete cases of spatial justice and injustice in emerging economies and how contemporary theories apply there. It seeks to shift the attention given in the last few years to issues of spatial justice in the Global North, to issues of spatial justice in the booming metropolises of the South, where spatial fragmentation and inequality are extreme.2. Housing Provision and Management. Alternative models have flourished in the last decades to solve the increased demand of new houses and to answer current society needs. At the same time, the increasing number of new houses in the global south implies new challenges in the management of the housing stock in order to avoid quick neighborhood deterioration and devaluation. This section will review the opportunities for alternative approaches in housing provision and management in the context of China, Ghana and Chile. Some topics of interest are social innovation in housing, collaborative housing approaches, community self-organization and the role of the third sector in housing policies.3. Urban Resilience. One can say that communities on the emerging world are more resilient, since they face more complex social, economic and environmental challenges than the Global North. Nevertheless, it is imperative to go beyond that simplistic idea of struggling for survival. Emerging economies offer a fertile ground to conduct research on how to use these complex threats as an opportunity to build better urban environments. These section of the course will shed some light on case studies of resilience that applies alternative approaches on the topic.\nWeek 5 and 6: Final assignment The final assignment is aimed at developing a critical approach towards the issues, theories and contexts presented during the course.\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "EdX", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/edx"}, "university": {"text": "Delft University of Technology", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/delft-university-technology"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Darinka Czischke Ljubetic", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/darinka-czischke-ljubetic"}, {"text": "Dominic Stead", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/dominic-stead"}, {"text": "Igor Pessoa", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/igor-pessoa"}, {"text": "Luz Maria Vergara d\u2019Alen\u00e7on", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/luz-maria-vergara-d%E2%80%99alen%C3%A7on"}, {"text": "Roberto Rocco", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/roberto-rocco"}], "category": {"text": "Art, Architecture & Design", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/art-architecture-design"}, "country": {"text": "Netherlands", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/netherlands"}, "duration": {"text": "6 Weeks", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/6-weeks"}, "frequency": {"text": "3-4 hours/week", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/3-4-hoursweek"}, "exam": {"text": "Yes, Free Exam and/or Final Project", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/yes-free-exam-andor-final-project"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Verified Certificate (Paid)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-verified-certificate-paid"}, "language": {"text": "English", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/english"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/analisis-de-datos-diseno-y-visualizacion-de-tableros-edx", "title": "An\u00e1lisis de datos: Dise\u00f1o y Visualizaci\u00f3n de Tableros (edX)", "description": "STARTS\nAprende c\u00f3mo transformar datos sin procesar, con el uso de tableros en Excel, para apoyar las decisiones de negocio. \u00bfLuchando con los datos en tu trabajo? \u00bfGastando tiempo valioso trabajando en muchas hojas de c\u00e1lculo en Excel para obtener un resumen de tu negocio? \u00bfTienes dificultades para obtener un tablero detallado a partir de montones de datos en tu escritorio? \u00bfQuieres entender c\u00f3mo analizar Big Data?\nSi est\u00e1s buscando mejorar tu eficiencia en la oficina y aumentar tu rendimiento mediante una forma m\u00e1s r\u00e1pida e inteligente de darle sentido a los datos, utilizando diferentes t\u00e9cnicas de an\u00e1lisis de datos, entonces este curso avanzado de an\u00e1lisis de datos es para ti.\nSi ya tienes habilidades con las hojas de c\u00e1lculo, este curso te ayudar\u00e1 a profundizar tus conocimientos a\u00fan m\u00e1s.

We will use three motivating examples and the ggplot2, a data visualization package for the statistical programming language R, to code. To learn the very basics, we will start with a somewhat artificial example: heights reported by students. Then use case studies related to world health and economics and another in infectious disease trends in the United States.It is also important to note that mistakes, biases, systematic errors and other unexpected problems often lead to data that should be handled with care. The fact that it can be difficult or impossible to notice an error just from the reported results makes data visualization particularly important.

Thus, many engineering teams develop software that supports their native language first, postponing support for other languages until \u201clater,\u201d when they think they will have the bandwidth. In other words, they don\u2019t plan ahead. The problem with this approach, which experienced developers have found out the hard way, is that it sacrifices budget, time, and opportunity.Redesigning and rebuilding a different edition of your software for each and every language or market can be a colossal effort. As this computer science course will demonstrate, planning ahead is far more efficient, and the marginal cost of supporting multiple languages from the get go is less than you may think. Harnessing international functionality in operating systems and programming languages makes writing code that works for multiple languages and markets much simpler than retrofitting existing code.The instructors for this course include programmers who have worked on globalization and localization of some of the world\u2019s most successful software. They\u2019ve experienced the good, the bad, and the ugly of creating world-ready software, and they\u2019re here to ensure your software\u2019s user experience works consistently, regardless of where users are from or what languages they speak.This course has three parts: the business case, world-ready design, and world-ready development.

With this in mind, it is no surprise that one fourth of the CEOs of the world\u2019s 100 largest corporations have an engineering degree.Solving these global problems requires leaders who, in the first place, are comfortable with technology, models and quantitative analyses -- Leaders who see systems instead of isolated problems. However, simply understanding technology is not enough. Successful leaders today must have both the ideas and the know-how to put these ideas into action by working collaboratively with others, winning their hearts and minds.We need leaders who know how to seize opportunities in a networked world, and can mobilize people and other stakeholders for large-scale change. Leaders who lead fulfilling lives and who are able to move themselves and others from the \u2018me\u2019 to the \u2018we\u2019. Leaders who are long-term oriented and who deliver economic profit, while also making positive contributions to society and the environment. We call these leaders \u2018sustainable leaders\u2019.This course has three parts:- In the first part, you will explore the context that leaders are facing, building an understanding of the complexities of global and business challenges. You will discover the ambiguities and the many stakeholders that leaders must consider when making their choices. You will get a sense of effective leadership practices.- In the second part, you will discover your \u201cwho am I\u201d through personal and group exercises.

Whether you are an EU citizen or not, this course concerns you! The EU is a major global actor in the field of human rights. EU treaties state that human rights are a fundamental value of the Union, which must be a \u2018silver thread\u2019 in all its policies.\nThe EU now acts within an impressive array of competences, and therefore has the potential to impact \u2013 positively or negatively \u2013 anyone\u2019s human rights.This EU and Human Rights course teaches the basics of human rights, placing the EU at the centre of investigation. The course will examine a number of key questions: - What factors are key to making the EU a positive or a negative force for human rights? An example is the economic crisis: what impact has it had on people\u2019s human rights in the EU and the world? - Which actors, friends or foes, must the EU engage with to successfully promote human rights? Examples include NGOs, businesses, or other international organisations like the Council of Europe or the United Nations. - In key policy sectors in which the EU is active, what is on balance the impact of the EU? Examples include trade, development, migration social policy or international crisis management.\nAll of the course activities aim to improve your understanding of how the EU, alone or in combination with other local or global, state or non-state actors, can better promote and uphold human rights worldwide.The course is intended for anyone interested in human rights and the EU, human rights law, European law, European Studies, international relations, global governance, etc.It is divided into four modules:1: The EU and Human Rights: Value Promotion and Coherence2: Promoting Human Rights inside the EU3: Promoting Human Rights in EU External Action4: Capitalising on Success and Remedying Flaws\nWhat you'll learn: - How the EU works - What the EU does - How the EU affects human rights - Where the EU can do better to be a positive force for human rights\nWeek 1: Human Rights Challenges in EU Policies The course will first outline the background to EU action, presenting the environment in which the EU acts. The focus will then move to the challenges and factors that affect EU performance in relation to human rights.\nWeek 2: EU as a Human Rights Actor In this week the core concept of human rights will be introduced, and examined in relation to two other values making up the EU\u2019s constitutional triad: namely the rule of law and democracy.

Explore how this unusual form of locomotion evolved and why. Have you ever wondered why humans walk on two legs rather than four? In this course, we will explore how science investigates this unusual form of locomotion. We will start our investigation by looking at the mechanics of upright walking in humans and comparing that to bipedal locomotion in large birds, bears, and apes.\nWe will journey back millions of years into the human fossil record in an effort to understand how and why upright walking evolved. Around our first birthday, each of us learned how to walk, but how does this happen? With bipedalism came costly trade-offs as well-- we\u2019ll examine these aches and pains as byproducts of our evolutionary history.\nThis course will take an intentionally interdisciplinary approach to studying how and why humans move bipedally.

Probabilistic modeling and the related field of statistical inference are the keys to analyzing data and making scientifically sound predictions.\nThis is Part 1 of a 2-part sequence on the basic tools of probabilistic modeling. Part 1 introduces the general framework of probability models, multiple discrete or continuous random variables, expectations, conditional distributions, and various powerful tools of general applicability. Part 2 will then continue into further topics that include laws of large numbers, the main tools of Bayesian inference methods, and an introduction to random processes (Poisson processes and Markov chains).The contents of the two parts of the course are essentially the same as those of the corresponding MIT class, which has been offered and continuously refined over more than 50 years. It is a challenging class, but will enable you to apply the tools of probability theory to real-world applications or your research.Probabilistic models use the language of mathematics.

Through presence alone, can caregivers heal what they cannot cure?\nIn Artful Medicine: Art\u2019s Power to Enrich Patient Care, we will explore the meaning of medical professionalism, techniques for a humanistic approach to caregiving, and the positive impact of humanism on clinical outcomes.\nBy looking closely at works of art that portray empathy in human interaction, caregivers can discover their common humanity with patients. Caregivers can also hone observation skills that help paint a portrait of a patient as a person and not a collection of symptoms, lab tests, and scans. Through presence at the patient\u2019s side, unmediated by technology, a caregiver can make the patient feel cared for in addition to being treated.One needn\u2019t be a caregiver to benefit from this course\u2014though all of us have probably been cared for at some point and can therefore easily relate to the importance of a humanistic approach to caregiving.

A pesar de que muchas personas siguen muriendo a la espera de recibir un \u00f3rgano, en ning\u00fan pa\u00eds se confiscan los \u00f3rganos de las personas fallecidas. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9? \u00bfPueden donar los menores? \u00bfDebemos prescindir de la conocida como \u201cregla del donante cad\u00e1ver\u201d y permitir la eutanasia para la donaci\u00f3n? \u00bfCon qu\u00e9 l\u00edmites? \u00bfDe qu\u00e9 manera influye la potencial condici\u00f3n de donante de un \u00f3rgano en los cuidados que se proporcionan al final de la vida? \u00bfC\u00f3mo evitar el conflicto de intereses entre quienes velan por la vida de los futuros receptores de un \u00f3rgano y quienes a\u00fan se afanan por cuidar a quien va a fallecer de manera irremisible e inminente?En este curso nos adentraremos en el an\u00e1lisis de \u00e9sas y otras cuestiones, pero tambi\u00e9n introduciremos los nuevos desaf\u00edos que para la \u00e9tica y el Derecho plantean trasplantes novedosos as\u00ed como la discusi\u00f3n en torno a los criterios de justa distribuci\u00f3n de los \u00f3rganos--------The first successful organ transplantation was performed in 1954. Since then, the technique has evolved tremendously, giving hope and increased quality of life to many patients around the world. While the technology and drugs advance, several controversies persist regarding the way in which organs may be obtained. Some of these dilemmas arose on the very first day in which organs\u2019 transplantation originated; others have emerged as a result of new phenomena such as transplantation tourism, the new possibilities brought by donation after cardio-circulatory death, or increasing knowledge about the remaining physiological functions detected in patients pronounced as brain dead. Almost all countries in the world forbid the selling of organs. Why? Although many people die while on the waiting lists, in no country does the Government confiscate cadaveric organs. Why? May minors be organ donors? Should we abandon the so-called \u201cdead donor rule\u201d and allow \u201corgan-donation euthanasia\u201d? How does the potential condition of becoming a donor influence the administration of end-of-life care? How should we avoid the eventual conflict of interests between those who care for the life of future recipients of organs and those who are in charge of the dying patient-eventual-donor? In this course we will explore the answers to these questions, and we will also engage in the assessment of the more recent challenges posed by novel transplantation techniques, and, albeit briefly, in the discussion regarding the fair distribution of organs.

Architecture engages a culture\u2019s deepest social values and expresses them in material, aesthetic form. In this course, you will learn how to \u201cread\u201d architecture as a cultural expression as well as a technical achievement. Vivid analyses of exemplary buildings from a wide range of historical contexts, coupled with hands-on exercises in drawing and modeling, bring you close to the work of an actual architect or historian.\nArchitecture is one of the most complexly negotiated and globally recognized cultural practices, both as an academic subject and a professional career. Its production involves all of the technical, aesthetic, political, and economic issues at play within a given society. Over the course of ten modules, we\u2019ll examine some of history\u2019s most important examples that show how architecture engages, mediates, and expresses a culture\u2019s complex aspirations.\nThe first part of the course introduces the idea of the architectural imagination as a faculty that mediates sensuous experience and conceptual understanding. Two examples of the architectural imagination\u2014perspective drawing and architectural typology\u2014are explored through video presentations and hands-on exercises. You will be introduced to some of the challenges involved in writing architectural history, revealing that architecture does not always have a straightforward relationship to its own history.In the second set of modules, we address technology as a component of architecture\u2019s realization and understanding. Architecture is embedded in contexts where technologies and materials of construction\u2014glass and steel, reinforced concrete\u2014are crucial agents of change. But a society\u2019s technology does not determine its architectural forms. You will discover ways that innovative technology can enable and promote new aesthetic experiences, or disrupt age-old traditions. You will witness architecture\u2019s ways of converting brute technical means into meaningful perceptions and textures of daily life. The interactions of architecture and modern technologies changed not only what could be built, but also what kinds of constructions could even be thought of as architecture.The final set of modules confronts architecture\u2019s complex relationship to its social and historical contexts and its audiences, achievements, and aspirations. As a professional practice deeply embedded in society, architecture has social obligations and the aesthetic power to negotiate social change; to carry collective memories; even to express society\u2019s utopian ideals. You will learn about what we call architecture\u2019s power of representation, and see how architecture has a particular capacity to produce collective meaning and memories.\nWhat you'll learn:- How to read, analyze, and understand different forms of architectural representation- Social and historical contexts behind major works of architecture- Basic principles to produce your own architectural drawings and models- Pertinent content for academic study or a professional career as an architect\nPart I: Form and HistoryModule 1: The Architectural Imagination: An IntroductionModule 2: Reading Architecture: Column and WallModule 3: Hegel and Architectural HistoryModule 4: Aldo Rossi and Typology\nPart II: The Technology EffectModule 5: The Crystal Palace: Infrastructure and DetailModule 6: The Dialectics of Glass and SteelModule 7: Technology Tamed: Le Corbusier\u2019s Machines for Living\nPart III: Representation and ContextModule 8: Drawing Utopia: Visionary Architecture of the 18th CenturyModule 9: The Pompidou Center in the City of ParisModule 10: Presenting the Unrepresentable\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "EdX", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/edx"}, "university": {"text": "Harvard University", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/harvard-university"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Antoine Picon", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/antoine-picon"}, {"text": "Erika Naginski", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/erika-naginski"}, {"text": "K.

Colors have different symbolism depending on cultural norms. And to accommodate all these differences, you want to do everything you possibly can to avoid the colossal effort of redesigning and rebuilding a different edition of your software for each and every market.This computer science course focuses on two aspects of \u201cworld-ready\u201d design. The first is globalization: making the user experience and the code that implements it generic enough to accommodate most market differences. The second aspect is localization: customizing features for the local market. The more globalized your design, the easier it is to localize.The course instructors include designers and programmers who have worked on globalization and localization of some of the world\u2019s most successful software. They\u2019ve experienced the good, the bad, and the ugly of creating world-ready software, and they\u2019re here to ensure your software\u2019s user experience is one all your customers will enjoy, regardless of where they\u2019re from or what language they speak.Previous programming or User Experience design experience is always helpful, but not necessary for this course.

After discussing the institution of slavery and its central role in the southern and national economies, it turns to an account of the political and social history of the 1850s. It traces how the issue of the expansion of slavery came to dominate national politics, and how political leaders struggled, unsuccessfully, to resolve the growing crisis. We will examine the impact of key events such as Bleeding Kansas, the Dred Scott decision, the Lincoln-Douglas debates, and John Brown\u2019s raid on Harper\u2019s Ferry, and end with the dissolution of the Union in the winter of 1860-61.This course is part of the X Series, Civil War and Reconstruction, which introduces students to the most pivotal era in American history. The Civil War transformed the nation by eliminating the threat of secession and destroying the institution of slavery. It raised questions that remain central to our understanding of ourselves as a people and a nation \u2013 the balance of power between local and national authority, the boundaries of citizenship, and the meanings of freedom and equality. This X Series will examine the causes of the war, the road to secession, the conduct of the Civil War, the coming of emancipation, and the struggle after the war to breathe meaning into the promise of freedom for four million emancipated slaves. One theme throughout the series is what might be called the politics of history \u2013 how the world in which a historian lives affects his or her view of the past, and how historical interpretations reinforce or challenge the social order of the present.What you'll learn: - An overview of the political and social history of the 1850s - How generations of historians have explained the crisis of the Union - Slavery\u2019s central role in the southern and national economies - How the issue of the expansion of slavery came to dominate national politics - Reasons for Lincoln\u2019s rise to national prominence - How political leaders struggled, unsuccessfully, to resolve the growing crisis in the nation.

However, this novel is most remembered for its depiction of health violations and unclean conditions in the American meatpacking industry.These findings were based on an investigation Sinclair did as a journalist.. Sinclair spent several weeks gathering information while working in the meatpacking plants of the Chicago stockyards for the newspaper Appeal to Reason. The Jungle was first published in serial form in 1905 in the newspaper. A film version of the novel was made in 1914, but it has been lost.The novel highlights working class poverty, the lack of social support, harsh living and working conditions, and a bleak outlook for the working poor.

Everything has a beginning and everything must be built from the ground up. This holds true even when it comes to software engineering and programming languages. Data structures provide a grounding for programming language and hold data and codes that determine what action will trigger what reaction.\nData structures and Algorithms are two important concepts when it comes to learning any programming language, functional or object oriented, from the ground up. In order to master a language, you must first master the basic groundwork for that language.\nData structures such as lists, trees, maps, etc. represent underlying data and are often required to be sorted and merged, transformed and matched in some way. To do this manually, it would require a lot of time and man power, which is where algorithms play a crucial role. Software engineers have created algorithms that provide a solution for this task, which is consistent, repeatable and testable with a set of metrics to quantify performance.For your system to work without a hitch, your data structures must be perform perfectly, which means that your algorithms should be accurate and designed for efficiency. This course is where you can learn exactly how to do that!We have designed a course to get you back to basics, so that you can create clean, efficient and powerful algorithms to help you improve the performance of your system and avoid any major critical bottleneck during operations.This course has been broken down into nine sections that cover five major categories of algorithms as well as its underlying concepts: Cryptography, Compiler Theory, Signal Processing, Data Analysis, and Graph Databases.In addition to theory, the course also includes numerous practical examples and applications of data structures and algorithms. Practical application is definitely important, especially when it comes to algorithms because in tech interviews and tests, questions are usually asked on the applicant\u2019s ability to solve problems by creating algorithms that are based on the theory. So, this course will make a great refresher if you are trying to study for a test or apply for a job in the tech field!At the end of this course, you will:- Have a deeper understanding of algorithms and its basic concepts- Understand acronyms such as ADT, AST, BFS and DFS- Have learned recursion and its relationship to concurrency (multi branch, memoization) and ADT\u2019s like Trees and Graphs- Understand trees and the rotation operations used in balancing.- Know in detail about parsing grammars with Stacks and Queues and related tools like AST based parsers the beginning step on the road to Compiler theory- Understand operations with Primes and engaged some of the interesting and accessible underlying mathematics like Fermat's theoremWith the fast-paced development in the field of Software Engineering, it is impossible to predict future technologies and languages that may be written. Hence, it is important to understand the pure concepts that are the building blocks of each language and technology that may arise.So, what are you waiting for?

Ce MOOC vous propose de comparer les \u00e9l\u00e9ments les plus marquants du droit allemand des contrats avec ceux de la r\u00e9forme 2016 du droit fran\u00e7ais des contrats. Il permet donc de d\u00e9couvrir les apports de la r\u00e9forme 2016, mais surtout de s'initier au droit allemand des contrats. Il est notamment utile \u00e0 ceux dont l'activit\u00e9 actuelle ou future concerne les \u00e9changes \u00e9conomiques entre la France et l\u2019Allemagne.\nEn effet, le droit allemand r\u00e9git, plus souvent que le droit fran\u00e7ais, ces relations. Les tribunaux fran\u00e7ais sont souvent amen\u00e9s \u00e0 l'appliquer. Au demeurant, la r\u00e9forme 2016 du droit fran\u00e7ais fait un trait d'union entre l\u2019ancien droit fran\u00e7ais et le droit allemand des contrats, ce qui permet une appr\u00e9hension facile par des personnes famili\u00e8res du droit fran\u00e7ais, ancien ou nouveau. Par ailleurs, cette r\u00e9forme doit encore \u00eatre pr\u00e9cis\u00e9e par la jurisprudence. La connaissance du droit allemand qui consacre depuis longtemps la plupart des m\u00e9canismes port\u00e9s par la r\u00e9forme fran\u00e7aise, permet de faire des projections quant \u00e0 l'application du nouveau droit fran\u00e7ais.\nDes vid\u00e9os et documents de cours ainsi que des quiz hebdomadaires vous permettront de conna\u00eetre ces deux droits que des cas pratiques vous permettront de mettre en application. L'enseignement comprend deux niveaux. Le premier niveau transmet une information d\u00e9taill\u00e9e et donne lieu, si l'apprenant le souhaite, \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation. Le second niveau, destin\u00e9 aux personnes press\u00e9es, se limite \u00e0 l'essentiel.\n- Module 0 : Introduction et notions essentielles du droit allemand pour appliquer le droit des contratsPropos introductifDivergences entre droit allemand et droit fran\u00e7ais concernant la preuveDivergences entre droit allemand et droit fran\u00e7ais concernant la prescription- Module 1 : Des probl\u00e8mes dans la formation du contrat : \u00e9l\u00e9ments nouveaux relatifs aux conditions de fond classiquesDes diff\u00e9rences dans la sanction des conditions de formation du contratL\u2019erreur, vice du consentementLe dol et la violenceLe contenu du contrat- Module 2 : Un probl\u00e8me dans la formation du contrat : les clauses abusives dans les contrats d\u2019adh\u00e9sionInspiration et champ d'application de l'encadrement des contrats d'adh\u00e9sionRencontre des volont\u00e9s quant aux clauses pr\u00e9r\u00e9dig\u00e9esContenu des clauses pr\u00e9r\u00e9dig\u00e9esSanctions des clauses pr\u00e9r\u00e9dig\u00e9es abusives- Module 3 : Des m\u00e9canismes pour mettre au point et pour pr\u00e9venir des probl\u00e8mesLes sommations interrogatoiresUne mise en demeure assortie d\u2019un d\u00e9lai raisonnable pour r\u00e9gulariser une situation- Module 4 : Des probl\u00e8mes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du contrat : sanctionsL\u2019unilat\u00e9ralisme dans les sanctionsCumul et hi\u00e9rarchie des sanctions- Module 5 : Des probl\u00e8mes particuliers dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du contrat : solutionsL\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter et ses cons\u00e9quences, notamment dans le droit de la venteL\u2019impr\u00e9vision\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "FUN", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/fun"}, "university": {"text": "Universit\u00e9 de Valenciennes et du Hainaut-Cambr\u00e9sis", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/universit%C3%A9-de-valenciennes-et-du-hainaut-cambr%C3%A9sis"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Eva Fischer-Achoura", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/eva-fischer-achoura"}], "category": {"text": "Management & Leadership", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/management-leadership"}, "country": {"text": "France", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/france"}, "duration": {"text": "6 Weeks", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/6-weeks"}, "frequency": {"text": "3 hours/week", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/3-hoursweek"}, "exam": {"text": "No Exam and/or Final Project information", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/no-exam-andor-final-project-information"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Statement of Accomplishment (Free Certificate)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-statement-accomplishment-free-certificate"}, "language": {"text": "French", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/french"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/sante-sexuelle-pour-tous-partie-1-fun", "title": "Sant\u00e9 sexuelle pour tous (partie 1) (FUN)", "description": "STARTS\nCe MOOC s\u2019inscrit dans une strat\u00e9gie nationale de sant\u00e9 sexuelle agenda 2030 pour la France et l\u2019international.

Influenza is a disease that strikes in two forms. Seasonal influenza returns each winter, killing up to half a million people in bad years and causing much misery.\n Pandemic influenza, by contrast, is rare - having occurred only a handful of times in the last century - and far worse than seasonal flu, often killing many millions across the world. The worst pandemic of all, the \u201cSpanish Flu\u201d of 1918, killed over twice as many people as the First World War - some estimates are even higher.Since 1918, our understanding of influenza virus has come a long way. We can now trace how the pandemics of the last hundred years originated in bird flu and swine flu, and we can model the evolution of the virus from year to year, aiding vaccine design. We also have some anti-viral drugs that can be used in emergencies, and we understand more about how flu is transmitted and possible ways to prevent its spread.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nIn this free online course, we will cover everything from the history of influenza to modern laboratory diagnostics and vaccination. You\u2019ll learn about the annual cycle that brings seasonal flu to our shores every winter, and also how avian and pig flus can contribute to the emergence of new pandemic strains of flu.We\u2019ll also look at the structure of the virus in more detail, seeing how the study of influenza is now carried out at the molecular level.As well as mini-lectures, there will be laboratory demonstrations, interviews with experts in a variety of relevant fields, and discussion sessions, where you\u2019ll be invited to contribute your own experiences and opinions to the subject of flu, and how we should treat and prevent it.\n RequirementsThe course is suitable for anyone with a general interest in health and disease - from school students to health professionals.Derek and his team won\u2019t be available to answer questions or respond to your comments during this course.

During that time the geography of our world has changed radically as coastal regions have flooded and islands have risen up, or been lost beneath the waves. With 70% of the world\u2019s surface covered by water, an unparalleled, yet largely untouched record of human life has been left beneath the sea for us to discover, from our earliest ancestors right through to present day.\nOver the length of this \u2018Shipwrecks and Submerged Worlds\u2019 course we will learn about maritime archaeology together - exploring underwater landscapes from the ancient Mediterranean to the prehistoric North Sea, and consider Shipwrecks from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific coast of the Americas.We will introduce you to the pioneers of the discipline and explain what maritime archaeology is and why it is relevant today. We\u2019ll also explore the technologies used to investigate these challenging environments and the new horizons that are opening to us daily.

In times of economic uncertainty and increasing migration within Europe, the relationship between Switzerland and the European Union (EU) is severely tested. Located in the west of the European continent, Switzerland is a small but wealthy country, which is surprisingly not a member of the EU. Did you ever wonder what the reasons for this are? And have you ever thought about what legal conditions govern this exceptional relationship?\nIn this free online course, we will attempt to answer some key questions, including: - What is the general place of Switzerland in the \u2018legal (and political) landscape\u2019 of Europe? - What effect does the special situation of Switzerland have for the debate in other countries on issues such as taxation and migration?\nLearn to distinguish fact from mythThis course offers a legal and political look at the position of Switzerland in Europe and its challenges as a non-Member State of the EU. We will put a particular focus on much debated and sometimes misunderstood issues such as corporate taxation, banking secrecy and the debate about curbing immigration. With this in mind, you will be able to reflect on Switzerland, the EU and regional integration on a differentiated basis.\nExpand your knowledge through case studiesIn addition to case studies on \u2018money\u2019 and \u2018migration\u2019, we will also discuss the present negotiations between Switzerland and the EU on the institutional framework of the Swiss-EU legal relationship. Studying the case of Switzerland from different angles will not only further your legal knowledge but also sharpen your awareness of the high degree of interconnectedness of countries in the modern world. After this course you should be able to apply your knowledge in other contexts - for example, when assessing news about regional integration in Europe or elsewhere.\nLearning outcomes - Reflect on the interconnectedness of states in the modern world. - Describe the federal structure of Switzerland. . - Debate corporate taxation and banking secrecy against the background of global and regional rules. - Explore the interests involved in economic migration. - Compare the legal concept of free movement of persons with national debates on curbing migration. - Develop an opinion on the rules on persons seeking international protection. - Summarise the present system of Swiss-EU agreements. - Collect arguments \u2018why Switzerland should or should not join the EU\u2019.\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "FutureLearn", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/futurelearn"}, "university": {"text": "University of Basel", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/university-basel"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Christa Tobler", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/christa-tobler"}, {"text": "Janine Dumont", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/janine-dumont"}], "category": {"text": "Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/social-sciences"}, "country": {"text": "Switzerland", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/switzerland"}, "duration": {"text": "6 Weeks", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/6-weeks"}, "frequency": {"text": "4 hours/week", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/4-hoursweek"}, "exam": {"text": "No Exam and/or Final Project information", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/no-exam-andor-final-project-information"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Verified Certificate (Paid)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-verified-certificate-paid"}, "language": {"text": "English", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/english"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/visual-effects-guerrilla-filmmakers-futurelearn", "title": " Visual Effects for Guerrilla Filmmakers (FutureLearn)", "description": "STARTS\nLearn how to create no-budget visual effects (VFX) and take your filmmaking to a new level, with this free online course.\nVisual effects (VFX) has long been a fascinating and mysterious process, but today the technology is available to us all.

Policies about managing nature should be economically and environmentally sound, but they also need to be formulated with social fairness if they are to be sustainable. Inevitably, when there are so many different values, conflicts occur and worlds collide.We start the course by examining a number of basic principles and then apply them to two case studies.

To broaden our horizon of what is and might be possible and what has already been attempted, and what has succeeded or even failed - and why.In several little tasks you'll analyse and practise storytelling on your own and in teams.\nMore info: https://iversity.org/c/6?r=2548d\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Iversity", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/iversity"}, "university": {"text": "Fachhochschule Potsdam", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/fachhochschule-potsdam"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Christina Maria Schollerer", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/christina-maria-schollerer"}, {"text": "Various Instructors", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/various-instructors"}], "category": {"text": "Marketing & Communication", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/marketing-communication"}, "country": {"text": "Germany", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/germany"}, "duration": {"text": "8 Weeks", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/8-weeks"}, "frequency": {"text": "2-3 hours/week", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/2-3-hoursweek"}, "exam": {"text": "No Exam and/or Final Project information", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/no-exam-andor-final-project-information"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Statement of Accomplishment (Free Certificate)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-statement-accomplishment-free-certificate"}, "language": {"text": "English", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/english"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/data-plane-programming-kau", "title": "Data Plane Programming (KAU)", "description": "STARTS\nA hybrid mooc on making the network data plane more flexible and programmable. Programmable Networks are of great importance. It is the starting point for making computer networks open for innovation, and enables the rapid introduction of new functionalities that make our networks more scalable, reliable and effective. Especially the data plane is important because it determines the speed, capacity and latency that distributed applications and services will experience.\nAt Karlstad University, we have developed advanced level academic courses on how to make the network data plane more flexible and programmable.\nTraditionally, network equipment has been seen as a closed box with little opportunity to invent. With the recent support of new programming languages such as P4, compiler and runtime support, the next generation of network equipment will be programmable, enabling new use cases. The course is divided into three modules. In the first module, we will introduce the concept of programmable data planes, including P4. In the second part, we will look into how we can use programmable data planes for data-center loadbalancing. Finally, part three covers techniques that enable network monitoring, in-network caching and facilitate simple computing operations with programmable data planes.\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "KAU", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/kau"}, "university": {"text": "Karlstad Business School", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/karlstad-business-school"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Andreas Kassler", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/andreas-kassler"}, {"text": "Christian Hernandez", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/christian-hernandez"}, {"text": "Deval Bhamare", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/deval-bhamare"}, {"text": "Jonathan Vestin", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/jonathan-vestin"}], "category": {"text": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/computer-science"}, "country": {"text": "Sweden", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/sweden"}, "duration": {"text": "20 Weeks", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/20-weeks"}, "frequency": {"text": "4-6 hours/week", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/4-6-hoursweek"}, "exam": {"text": "No Exam or Final Project", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/no-exam-or-final-project"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Statement of Accomplishment (Free Certificate)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-statement-accomplishment-free-certificate"}, "language": {"text": "English", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/english"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/comics-art-relationship-kadenze", "title": "Comics: Art in Relationship (kadenze)", "description": "STARTS\nComics are one of the most popular and exciting ways to tell a story.

Images of today's celebrities and fashion mavens are ever-present, but long before the selfie, sculpture and painting captured individuals and their fashion styling. Designers still look to these powerful sources for fashion elements and inspiration, and this course will trace the history of clothing and the way that themes have been interpreted over the last 500 years.\nStarting in the 15th century, we will view the fashion biographies of notable individuals and examine garments and \u2018looks\u2019 for their trend-setting elements. Fashion is extremely and pointedly cyclical, and garment elements and design ideas that look \u2018fresh\u2019 to a certain generation can often be directly or indirectly traced to a prior moment or figure in history.\nIn this course we will look at some of these times and people, and compare and contrast them to fashion that has emerged. Contemporary designs will be reviewed to identify the reuse or redefinition of many of these details. We will progressively develop the eye and skill to sketch and create our own ideas through a creative journaling process, culminating in an original design project based on historical elements.\nThis course is in adaptive mode and is open for enrollment.- Session 1: From Fashion\u2019s Rich Renaissance to Going BaroqueStyle Icons and Royal Clothes from 1450-1700- Session 2: The Turn of a Century Curves Into a CorsetFashions and the Fashionable from 1700 Through the Victorians- Session 3: From Edward to ErteThe Figures and Fashions that Comprised the Eras 1890-1920- Session 4: The Flirty 30s to the Sultry 70sTracing the Stars and Straps from 1930s into the 1970s- Session 5: Flashes in the Pan to Fashions on the Lam88 Versions of Tees on the Wall and the New Milleniums' Creatures of Creativity.- Session 6: From Research to RevelationUsing Fashion Inspired Materials in the Creative Process\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Kadenze", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/kadenze"}, "university": {"text": "Otis College of Art and Design", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/otis-college-art-and-design"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Amy Bond", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/amy-bond"}], "category": {"text": "Art, Architecture & Design", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/art-architecture-design"}, "country": {"text": "USA", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/usa"}, "duration": {"text": "Self-Paced", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/self-paced"}, "frequency": {"text": "Self study", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/self-study"}, "exam": {"text": "Yes, Paid Exam and/or Final Project", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/yes-paid-exam-andor-final-project"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Verified Certificate (Paid)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-verified-certificate-paid"}, "language": {"text": "English", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/english"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/online-jamming-and-concert-technology-kadenze", "title": "Online Jamming and Concert Technology (kadenze)", "description": "STARTS\nToday's vast amount of streaming and video conferencing on the Internet lacks one aspect of musical fun and that's what this course is about: high-quality, near-synchronous musical collaboration.

Whatever the discipline or discourse it is important to be able to distinguish correct reasoning from incorrect reasoning. The consequences of incorrect reasoning can be minor, like getting lost on the way to a birthday party, or more significant, for example launching nuclear missiles at a flock of ducks, or permanently losing contact with a space craft.\nThe fundamental question that we will address in this course is \"when does one statement necessarily follow from another\" --- or in the terminology of the course, \"when is one statement a logical consequence of another\". This is an issue of some importance, since an answer to the question would allow us to examine an argument presented in a blog, for example, and to decide whether it really demonstrates the truth of the conclusion of the argument. Our own reasoning might also improve, since we would also be able to analyze our own arguments to see whether they really do demonstrate their conclusions.In this course you will be introduced to the concepts and techniques used in logic. We will start right from the beginning, assuming no prior exposure to this or similar material, and progress through discussions of the proof and model theories of propositional and first-order logic.We will proceed by giving a theory of truth, and of logical consequence, based on a formal language called FOL (the language of First-Order Logic). We adopt a formal language for making statements, since natural languages (like English, for example) are far too vague and ambiguous for us to analyze sufficiently. Armed with the formal language, we will be able to model the notions of truth, proof and consequence, among others.While logic is technical in nature, the key concepts in the course will be developed by considering natural English statements, and we will focus the relationships between such statements and their FOL counterparts. The goal of the course is to show how natural English statements and arguments can be formalized and analyzed.\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Lagunita Stanford Online", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/lagunita-stanford-online"}, "university": {"text": "Stanford University", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/stanford-university"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Dave Barker-Plummer", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/dave-barker-plummer"}, {"text": "John Etchemendy", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/john-etchemendy"}], "category": {"text": "Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/social-sciences"}, "country": {"text": "USA", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/usa"}, "duration": {"text": "This Course is Not Available", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/course-not-available"}, "frequency": {"text": "No information", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/no-information"}, "exam": {"text": "Yes, Free Exam and/or Final Project", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/yes-free-exam-andor-final-project"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Statement of Accomplishment (Free Certificate)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-statement-accomplishment-free-certificate"}, "language": {"text": "English", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/english"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/introduction-r-leada", "title": " Introduction to R (Leada)", "description": "STARTS\nThe course gives you an introduction to using R.\nThe course will cover the basics from getting your own development environment setup all the way to doing basic computational tasks.\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Leada", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/leada"}, "university": {"text": "Leada, Inc", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/leada-inc"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Brian Liou", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/brian-liou"}], "category": {"text": "CS: Software Engineering", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/cs-software-engineering"}, "country": {"text": "USA", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/usa"}, "duration": {"text": "Self-Paced", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/self-paced"}, "frequency": {"text": "Self study", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/self-study"}, "exam": {"text": "No Exam or Final Project", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/no-exam-or-final-project"}, "certificate": {"text": "No Certificate", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/no-certificate"}, "language": {"text": "English", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/english"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/foster-team-and-individual-growth-learn-comau", "title": "Foster Team and Individual Growth (learn .com.au)", "description": "STARTS\nAny leader knows that they are only as capable as the team working alongside them.

This week we kick start the course by first exploring the importance of having a culture of learning within an organisation. Then we'll have a look at some important legislative frameworks which affect employees and the people that hire them. Finally, we'll look at organisational objectives and how they influence the foundation stones of any training and development: Position Descriptions and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).\nWeek 2 - Evaluating Employee Strengths and NeedsThis week is all about evaluating team competency and skill levels in order to determine where employee training needs currently lie. To help you identify areas for improvement in teams/individuals, we will start with ways to evaluate individual skills and competencies, including direct feedback from employees. We'll also go into methods of designing evaluation and feedback instruments so that you receive the right information from employees, then introduce the concepts of conducting individual performance reviews and identifying any skill gaps that exist.\nWeek 3 - Creating a Training & Development PlanThis week, we will cover the steps involved in developing a training plan for your organisation. We'll also explore ways to facilitate learning in the workplace, be introduced to the concept of learning styles and understand how those styles might be identified in individuals.\nWeek 4 - Types of Training, Delivery and SupportWelcome to Week 4! This week we're going to dive into the different types of learning and training delivery that you can choose from. We'll also look at two important ways to keep employees learning and motivated: mentoring and coaching. During your long career, you'll no doubt use both to help individuals in your team! Finally, we'll also touch on ways to find training resources.\nWeek 5 - Monitoring and Evaluating TrainingThis week we will look at what continuous improvement looks like when it comes to training and development programs. Once you've created training plans, and delivered training programs, the professional development of your team will need to be reviewed, adjusted and modified with time. This week will focus on reviewing the feedback we have received, as well as evaluating and modifying the training and development program in accordance with this feedback. We'll also look at maintaining training and performance records, so you can track your team's development.\nWeek 6 - The Finish Line (And Where To Next...)This week is the Finish Line - where you\u2019ll share your Major Tasks and showcase all the hard work you\u2019ve put in throughout the course.

Tamb\u00e9m abordamos alguns modelos simples de mec\u00e2nica cl\u00e1ssica e qu\u00e2ntica que usam a linguagem dos va.p. e ve.p. A descri\u00e7\u00e3o de uma aplica\u00e7\u00e3o moderna do processamento de imagens digitais vai permitir abordar o t\u00f3pico recente dos valores singulares. A decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o em valores singulares \u00e9 um t\u00f3pico, que apesar de n\u00e3o ser geralmente contemplado nos programas curriculares de uma primeira disciplina de \u00c1lgebra Linear, tem muito interesse nas aplica\u00e7\u00f5es e revela propriedades alg\u00e9bricas e geom\u00e9tricas fundamentais das matrizes e respetivas transforma\u00e7\u00f5es lineares.\nDo ponto de vista matem\u00e1tico, a abordagem dos va.p. e ve.p. neste curso inclui, para al\u00e9m da descri\u00e7\u00e3o do procedimento cl\u00e1ssico para os calcular, as quest\u00f5es da diagonaliza\u00e7\u00e3o e diagonaliza\u00e7\u00e3o ortogonal de matrizes e a an\u00e1lise do teorema espetral. Mostramos, ainda, alguns resultados sobre aproxima\u00e7\u00f5es para va.p. e ve.p. quando as matrizes s\u00e3o de grandes dimens\u00f5es. No caso de matrizes retangulares, introduzimos o conceito de valores singulares que s\u00e3o uma extens\u00e3o natural das boas propriedades das matrizes sim\u00e9tricas definidas positivas, chamando a aten\u00e7\u00e3o para o seu interesse para qualquer matriz diagonaliz\u00e1vel, ou n\u00e3o diagonaliz\u00e1vel.No final deste curso, os participantes dever\u00e3o estar aptos a:- calcular manualmente va.p. e ve.p. pr\u00f3prios para matrizes 2x2 e 3x3;- calcular, com recurso a software, va.p. e ve.p. pr\u00f3prios para matrizes mais complicadas;- interpretar o significado dos va.p e ve.p. no contexto de transforma\u00e7\u00f5es lineares, sistemas din\u00e2micos e formas quadr\u00e1ticas;- diagonalizar matrizes, classificar formas quadr\u00e1ticas e usar a decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o espetral em algumas aplica\u00e7\u00f5es;- aplicar o m\u00e9todo num\u00e9rico da pot\u00eancia para o c\u00e1lculo aproximado de va.p. e ve.p. dominantes.\nRecommended Readings:D.C.

This is a question increasingly asked by forward-thinking leaders in the social sector. Yet, while there is growing buzz around the need to scale solutions, there are limited frameworks or practical roadmaps to help social enterprises get there. How do you identify your core strengths and build upon them strategically? How do you grow in diverse and hard-to-reach markets? How do you avoid racing forward in an unfocused, and ultimately self-defeating, way? How do you achieve \"good scale\" and steer clear of \"bad scale\"?\n Enter the \"Repeatable Model\u00ae\". The Repeatable Models\u00ae framework has been developed by Bain & Company based on its experience working with high-performing companies across a range of industries and countries for decades. This experience has helped Bain identify what is required for companies to sustain their success over time. In this course, we'll show you how to apply this framework to the social sector to scale your work strategically across villages, regions and countries. Drawing from a report co-authored by Acumen and Bain called \"Growing Prosperity: Developing Repeatable Models\u00ae to Scale,\" this course will present practical advice and case studies from the founders and leaders of social ventures like One Acre Fund and Juhudi Kilimo who have successfully implemented Repeatable Models\u00ae. By the end of this 2.5 hour course, you'll have completed a diagnostic tool for your own enterprise and developed a plan for how to continuously implement your core services as you expand. You'll walk away with a deep appreciation of the link between simple strategy and sustainable growth.

In this openHPI course, we will give an introduction about components of human cells and their functions. We dive into the cell core to explore the Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA), its structure, and how it stores the code of life.\nFurthermore, we will explore how to discover genetic variants and mutations and how to assess their impact on the cell functions and the whole human body. Ultimately, we will outline how individual genetic variants can be connected to complex diseases, such as cancer. Just two decades ago, all these tasks would have been impossible due to missing knowledge about the DNA and a lack of computational power. As a result, you will learn basic concepts about how to incorporate latest computer science aspects to explore the code of life interactively.\n  Week 1: History of DNA and core components of cells: Back to school: let's test your current biology background. We will start with a concrete real-world use case from medicine to explain core components of human cells, their function, and how they interact. Week 2: Processing and analyzing of genetic data: How to turn genetic raw data into meaningful information is the content of this week. Specific data processing steps are required prior to interpreting genetic data. In this week we will address specific algorithms, IT methods, and processes to assess genetic data. Furthermore, you will gain hands-on experience in analyzing selected genetic variants and evaluating their relevance. Week 3: Online Q&A and final exams : In this week you will have the chance to discuss any open questions with the teaching team using our online tools. Furthermore, you will have to complete your final exams of the course in this week.

The goal is to present to the students the methodological approaches for the design of such systems, showing also real industrial tools, examples and common practices.\nNew application domains demand ever increasing adaptability and performance. In order to cope with changing user requirements, improvements in system features, changing protocol and data-coding standards, and demands for support of a variety of different user applications, many emerging applications in communication, computing and consumer electronics demand that their functionality stays flexible after the system has been manufactured. Reconfigurable Systems-on-a-Chips (SoCs) employing different microprocessor cores and different types of reconfigurable fabrics are one attractive solution for these domains. The increasing prominence of reconfigurable devices within such systems requires HW/SW co-design for SoCs to address the trade-off between software execution and reconfigurable hardware acceleration. Dynamic reconfiguration capabilities of current reconfigurable devices create an additional dimension in the temporal domain. During the design space exploration phase, overheads associated with reconfiguration and hardware/software interfacing need to be evaluated carefully in order to harvest the full potential of dynamic reconfiguration.The course will introduce the student with the concept of reconfigurability in FPGAs, presenting the available mechanisms and technologies at the device level and the tools and design methodologies required to design reconfigurable FPGA-based systems. The course will present the different aspects of the design of FPGA-based reconfigurable systems, focusing in particular on dynamically self-reconfigurable systems. The design methodologies and tools required to design a dynamically-reconfigurable system will be introduced and described, together with the problems that need to be considered.After this course you will be able to:- describe why reconfigurable computing can be seen as an extension of the HW/SW codesign;- illustrate the reconfigurable computing \u201ctaxonomy\u201d;- summarize the main concepts/terms introduced with respect to a reconfigurable computing scenario;- understand how a design flow to design and implement a reconfigurable system is working.Once a student completes this course, he will be ready to take more advanced FPGA courses.\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Polimi OPEN KNOWLEDGE", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/polimi-open-knowledge"}, "university": {"text": "Politecnico di Milano", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/politecnico-di-milano"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Marco Domenico Santambrogio", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/marco-domenico-santambrogio"}], "category": {"text": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/computer-science"}, "country": {"text": "Italy", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/italy"}, "duration": {"text": "The Course Length is not Available", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/course-length-not-available"}, "frequency": {"text": "2-3 hours/week", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/2-3-hoursweek"}, "exam": {"text": "No Exam and/or Final Project information", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/no-exam-andor-final-project-information"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Statement of Accomplishment (Free Certificate)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-statement-accomplishment-free-certificate"}, "language": {"text": "English", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/english"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/fundamentals-operations-pok", "title": "Fundamentals of Operations (POK)", "description": "STARTS\nThis course introduces the key theories, concepts, models and approaches related to Production and Logistics Systems.

Effectively, most modern mechanical engineering systems are mechatronic systems. Mechatronics is the discipline that results from the synergetic application of electrical, electronic, computer, and control engineering in mechanical engineering systems. Thus, it is essential for the mechanical engineer to have a strong understanding of the composition and design of mechatronic systems, which is the goal of this course.\nMechatronic systems are around us everywhere. A car contains many mechatronic systems, such as anti-lock braking systems, traction control, the engine control unit and cruise control, to name a few. A satellite dish position control unit is another example of a mechatronic system. Modern industrial automated processes would not be possible without the discipline of mechatronics, covering areas such as vehicle manufacturing, pharmaceutical industries, and food processing plants.

In this second semester of the Physical Chemistry course, you will study the principles and laws of quantum mechanics as well as the interaction between matter and electromagnetic waves. During the late 19th century and early 20th century, scientists opened new frontiers in the understanding of matter at the molecular, atomic, and sub-atomic scale. These studies resulted in the development of quantum physics, which nowadays is still considered one of the greatest achievements of human mind. While present day quantum physics \u201czooms in\u201d to look at subatomic particles, quantum chemistry \u201czooms out\u201d to look at large molecular systems in order to theoretically understand their physical and chemical properties. Quantum chemistry has created certain \u201ctools\u201d (or computational methods) based on the laws of quantum mechanics that make it theoretically possible to understand how electrons and atomic nuclei interact with each other to form any kind of matter, ranging from diamond crystals to DNA strands to proteins to plastic polymers. Using these tools, quantum chemists can simulate complex biological systems, such as nucleic acids, proteins, and even cells, in order to understand their functions and behavior. These tools are increasingly used by researchers at pharmaceutical companies as they need to simulate the interaction of a potential drug molecule with the target receptor, such as a protein binding pocket on the surface of a cell. Scientists use computational tools of quantum chemistry to predict the optical and electronic properties of novel materials to be used in advanced technologies, such as organic photovoltaics (OPVs) for solar energy harvesting and organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) for electronic displays. In these applications, scientists can \u201ccalculate\u201d the range of sunlight frequencies a certain material can absorb or the color of the emitted light in a pixel fabricated using certain molecules. Quantum chemistry treats light as both a wave and a particle and uses wavefunctions to describe systems composed by \u201ctangible\u201d matter, such as electrons and nuclei. A substantial portion of the course is dedicated to the theoretical understanding of the interactions between light (electromagnetic radiations) and matter (molecules, electrons, nuclei, etc.). These interactions are at the base of modern image techniques used in the medical field, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nThis senior course in quantum chemistry usually serves as an introduction to more advanced graduate courses in theoretical chemistry, rather than concluding your degree in chemistry. With the knowledge gained in this course, you will be able to calculate the energies of simple systems, such as small molecules. Keep in mind that these calculations of quantum chemistry are fairly complicated, thus you will learn several approximation techniques to aid your calculations of more advanced molecular systems. You will also be able to correlate the outcome of your calculation to certain physical properties of the molecule. In particular, you will learn how the spectroscopy properties are strictly interconnected with the electronic structure of molecules.\nUpon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:\n Describe the difference between classical and quantum mechanics. Explain the failure of classical mechanics in elucidating the black body radiation, the photoelectric effect, and atomic emission spectra. Define the wave-particle duality. Define the uncertainty principle. Solve the Hamiltonian for a particle in box, on a ring, and on a sphere. Solve the Schrodinger equation for hydrogen-like systems. Use technique of approximation to compute the Schrodinger equation for polyatomic systems. Describe the difference between the Valence Bond and the Molecular Orbital Theories. Identify the symmetry elements in a molecule. Predict and explain the outcome of electromagnetic radiations interacting with matter. Define Raman spectroscopy. Predict the vibrational spectra of molecules based on their electronic structure. Explain the selection rules for a molecule to be Raman or IR active.

Econometrics is an application of statistical procedures to the testing of hypotheses about economic relationships and to the estimation of parameters.\nRegression analysis is the primary procedure commonly used by researchers and managers whether their employments are within the goods or the resources market and/or within the agriculture, the manufacturing, the services, or the information sectors of an economy. Completion of this course in econometrics will help you progress from a student of economics to a practitioner of economics. By completing this course, you will gain an overview of econometrics, develop your ability to think like an economist, hone your skills building and testing models of consumer and producer behavior, and synthesize the results you find through analyses of data pertaining to market-based economic systems. In essence, professional economists conduct studies that combine and project their expertise both in statistical procedures and analysis and in economic concepts and relationships. There are two major benefits to a study of econometrics: one is that it facilitates communication between econometricians and users of their work; the other is that it helps individuals to develop perspectives on econometric work and to make a critical evaluation of the work. Experience with econometrics and knowledge of the potential problems are essential for developing judgments about a study. For example, you could find yourself assessing studies that conclude the price of a gallon of gasoline has little influence on how much of it a driver purchases and findings that affirm the cost of producing a gallon of gasoline has little bearing on the current price of a gallon of gasoline you are pumping into your vehicle.Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:- Construct, test, and analyze econometric models, using variables and relationships commonly found in studies of economic theory.- Collect, organize, and analyze economic data, and interpret results from statistical analyses.- Identify the desirable properties of estimators.- Identify key classical assumptions in the field of econometrics, explain their significance, and describe the effects that violations of the classical assumptions can have.- Use the least squares method in evaluating the relationship of one explanatory variable to the dependent variable and the relationships of multiple explanatory variables to the dependent variable.- Interpret key statistics and diagnostics typically generated by software.Course Requirements:Have completed the following courses from the \u201cCore Program\u201d of the Economics discipline: Single-Variable Calculus I, Introduction to Statistics, and Principles of Microeconomics or Principles of Macroeconomics.\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Saylor Academy", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/saylor-academy"}, "university": {"text": "Saylor.org", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/saylororg"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Various Instructors", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/various-instructors"}], "category": {"text": "Economics & Finance", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/economics-finance"}, "country": {"text": "USA", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/usa"}, "duration": {"text": "This Course is Not Available", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/course-not-available"}, "frequency": {"text": "Self study", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/self-study"}, "exam": {"text": "Yes, Free Exam and/or Final Project", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/yes-free-exam-andor-final-project"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Statement of Accomplishment (Free Certificate)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-statement-accomplishment-free-certificate"}, "language": {"text": "English", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/english"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/lifespan-development-saylororg", "title": "Lifespan Development (saylor.org)", "description": "STARTS\nDevelopmental psychology concerns itself with the changes (psychological and otherwise) that occur as a result of our physical and mental maturation.

Typically, \u201cdevelopment\u201d refers to the systematic changes that take place between our conception and death. While this definition may seem quite broad, it will serve as a good starting point in our quest to understand the field of developmental psychology. The first thing we must realize as developmental psychologists is that our change is systematic. This means that the process by which we grow and mature over time is not defined by random, isolated events but by orderly and relatively long-term patterns. This also means that while individuals themselves may differ quite a bit, the developmental patterns that they undergo are similar. These concepts are crucial in that they allow us, as psychologists, to study the way in which people develop and to make predictions about the future based on that development. Developmental psychologists study both continuities and discontinuities in our development. Continuities refer to developmental patterns that remain the same throughout our lives, meaning that growth occurs steadily and smoothly. For example, some developmental psychologists examine links between infants\u2019 temperament and their personality characteristics in later childhood and adolescence. In contrast, discontinuities refer to developmental patterns that remain the same for lengthy periods but occasionally show relatively sudden, rapid change. For example, you will learn much about the stages of psychosocial development proposed by Erik Erikson, whose research suggested that individuals struggle with a predominant internal conflict at each of eight stages of the lifespan. With the successful resolution of each conflict, such as trust versus mistrust in infancy, individuals acquire a greater capacity to handle the hallmark conflicts of subsequent stages. This course emphasizes that development proceeds throughout all stages of the lifespan. After a brief introductory unit that will provide an overview of broad developmental issues, theories, and research methods, you will look at development in the womb, or prenatal development. The next three units examine development during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Within each unit, you will learn about key processes and issues related first to physical development, then to cognition (mental processes), and then to personality. Different subtopics will be emphasized in each lifespan stage. For instance, in the realm of cognitive development, language acquisition will be a major focus when you study childhood, since it is such a critical and amazing accomplishment of the early years. In adolescence, special attention will be given to how broad changes in thinking are linked specifically to growth in moral understanding. The course will conclude by exploring how humans approach and understand death.\nUpon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:\n describe the fundamental issues encountered and assumptions made by psychologists who study development from the lifespan perspective; discuss the interaction between and the roles of nature and nurture in lifespan development, including prenatal development; describe the basic development of the human nervous system throughout the lifespan; explain the developmental processes associated with the five senses; describe the important developmental milestones and age expectations associated with motor skills, social skills, cognitive ability, sensory awareness, and the use of language; discuss the important theories of cognitive development, including those of Piaget, Vygotsky, the information-processing approach, and the intelligence perspective; discuss and contrast the nativist, behavioral-cognitive, functionalist, and learning stage theories of language development; describe the developmental process of language, from cooing and babbling to mature language; explain the important theoretical issues in the study of the development of personality; discuss the most influential theories of personality development, including those of Freud, Erikson, Klein and Mahler, Bowlby, and Ainsworth; explain Kohlberg\u2019s theory of moral development, including the perspectives of its critics; describe the physical and cognitive changes associated with adolescent development; discuss the major issues of development in adulthood, including marriage and divorce, parenting, and midlife and later life physical and cognitive changes; discuss how humans understand and approach death and grieving, including the extent to which there are similarities and differences related to age, personality, and culture; and describe the components and criticisms of K\u00fcbler-Ross\u2019s theory regarding death.\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Saylor Academy", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/saylor-academy"}, "university": {"text": "Saylor.org", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/saylororg"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Various Instructors", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/various-instructors"}], "category": {"text": "Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/social-sciences"}, "country": {"text": "USA", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/usa"}, "duration": {"text": "Self-Paced", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/self-paced"}, "frequency": {"text": "Self study", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/self-study"}, "exam": {"text": "Yes, Free Exam and/or Final Project", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/yes-free-exam-andor-final-project"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Statement of Accomplishment (Free Certificate)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-statement-accomplishment-free-certificate"}, "language": {"text": "English", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/english"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/african-american-literature-saylororg", "title": " African-American Literature (saylor.org)", "description": "STARTS\nAfrican American literature grew out of the oral tradition of storytelling and spirituals.

You will learn where advertising fits in the Marketing Mix, also known as the four Ps: Product, Price, Place, and Promotion. Although some consider all promotion synonymous with advertising, you will learn the unique characteristics that separate advertising from other forms of promotional communication. You will re-visit some familiar marketing concepts within a new framework, approaching the subject from the advertiser\u2019s perspective.\nAdvertising is an integral part of our modern, media-dominated society. While many of us have a love-hate relationship with the industry, advertising can be wonderfully entertaining. However, is advertising a necessary evil? Does it make meaningful contributions to our society?With the incredible growth of social media, now is a particularly exciting time to explore the fascinating world of advertising.Our text uses a case-based approach that focuses on the activities of a successful advertising agency, Shepardson, Stern and Kaminsky (SS+K). You will see the practical applications of advertising theory as we follow SS+K through the formulation and implementation of a real-world advertising campaign. This model will allow you to see how businesses blend creativity with tested advertising principles to develop promotional communication that builds brand equity. You will learn that while creativity is certainly an important aspect of advertising, businesses must also follow a systematic planning approach to get the maximum value from their advertising spending. You will see advertising in an entirely new light as you examine the discipline through the lens of today\u2019s advertiser.As you work your way through the units, you will see that each one builds upon the ones before. After the overview of advertising\u2014where you will learn the definition of advertising, and how it fits into the marketing mix\u2014you will move on to advertising\u2019s place in our society. Next, you will learn about the ways in which advertisers communicate with us, and how and why consumers behave the way they do. Market research, an essential tool in uncovering information, follows. Here you will learn about the kinds of information needed to meet a market\u2019s needs, and the ways in which that information is obtained. After that, you will move on to how advertisers choose their target markets. Once this is determined, advertisers can set an appropriate budget for their advertising campaigns. This will be covered in unit 6. Unit 7 focuses on the next step in the process, which is advertising strategy\u2014the pathway to setting objectives and reaching advertising goals. Once goals and objectives are formulated, it is important to have a coordinated marketing effort\u2014this is covered in unit 8. Media planning, the process of determining where advertising will be placed, is the natural next step, and is covered in unit 9. And finally, once all aspects of a plan are in place, they need to be executed and then evaluated for effectiveness. These topics are covered in your last unit, unit 10.\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "Saylor Academy", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/saylor-academy"}, "university": {"text": "Saylor.org", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/saylororg"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Various Instructors", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/various-instructors"}], "category": {"text": "Management & Leadership", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/management-leadership"}, "country": {"text": "USA", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/usa"}, "duration": {"text": "Self-Paced", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/self-paced"}, "frequency": {"text": "Self study", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/self-study"}, "exam": {"text": "Yes, Free Exam and/or Final Project", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/yes-free-exam-andor-final-project"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Statement of Accomplishment (Free Certificate)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-statement-accomplishment-free-certificate"}, "language": {"text": "English", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/english"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/corporate-communication-saylororg", "title": "Corporate Communication (saylor.org)", "description": "STARTS\nThe introduction of Business Communication for Success, the textbook used throughout this course, notes that \u201c[E]ffective communication takes preparation, practice, and persistence.

That\u2019s just one of the reasons why true inclusive education can be so powerful. Spurred by human rights declarations, more European students with special educational needs (SEN) are joining mainstream schools. But what can teachers do to best support and teach SEN students, and to create an inclusive learning environment? Join the latest Teacher Academy online course \u201cSupporting Special Educational Needs in Every Classroom\u201d\u2013 starting 15 October \u2013 to better understand the topic, learn about easy tools, methods and approaches for inclusive classrooms and schools, and discover how to coordinate the work with other general and special education teachers.\nMore and more teachers in Europe face the challenge of integrating students with special needs in their mainstream classroom. This is partly the outcome of a general trend towards accommodating children with special needs in mainstream education schools rather than in special school settings. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, signed by all EU Member States, articulates the right of students with special needs to be taught in mainstream education. While this trend is a very welcome and necessary move towards a more inclusive Europe, it does provide new challenges to teachers that need to teach more diverse classrooms with more learners with particular needs.\nThe course provides an introduction to Special Educational Needs (SEN), and helps educators to teach and support SEN students both in- and outside the classroom. It does that by providing a better understanding of the definition, legal basis and identification of special needs education, and showing what easy changes can be implemented in their teaching to make the classroom more inclusive. Concretely, new methods and approaches are provided to intervene and make their teaching more inclusive, engage relevant actors (such as family and the local community) and getting external support if needed.\nCourse IntroductionModule 1: Introduction to Special EducationModule 2: Teaching children with SEN in the classroomModule 3: Teaching children with SEN beyond the classroomModule 4: SEN case studies & Final Activity\nView the discussion thread.", "provider": {"text": "SchoolEducationGateway", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/schooleducationgateway"}, "university": {"text": "School Education Gateway, Directorate General for Education and Culture of the European Commission", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/university-entity/school-education-gateway-directorate-general-education-and-culture-european"}, "instructors": [{"text": "Efi Saltidou", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/efi-saltidou"}, {"text": "Ruth Sanders", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/ruth-sanders"}], "category": {"text": "Education", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/categories/education"}, "country": {"text": "Belgium", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/countries/belgium"}, "duration": {"text": "6 Weeks", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/length/6-weeks"}, "frequency": {"text": "3 hours/week", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/estimated-effort/3-hoursweek"}, "exam": {"text": "Yes, Free Exam and/or Final Project", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/exam/yes-free-exam-andor-final-project"}, "certificate": {"text": "Yes, Open Badges and Yes, Statement of Accomplishment (Free Certificate)", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/certificate/yes-open-badges-and-yes-statement-accomplishment-free-certificate"}, "language": {"text": "English", "url": "https://www.mooc-list.com/language/english"}}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/course/exit-strategy-any-business-simpliv", "title": "Exit Strategy for any Business (Simpliv)", "description": "STARTS\nThe ultimate goal for most entrepreneurs is to build a business that will someday allow them to exit the business and capture the value that they have built in their company.
