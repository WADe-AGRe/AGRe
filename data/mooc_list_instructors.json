He became the Management Department\u2019s first Practice Professor for his work on applying theory and research to the real challenges facing organizations. As founding director of the Wharton Leadership Program, in 1991 he initiated the required MBA and Undergraduate leadership courses. He is also founding director of Wharton\u2019s Work/Life Integration Project.Stew\u2019s most recent book is Leading the Life You Want: Skills for Integrating Work and Life (Harvard Business, 2014). It builds on his award-winning bestseller, Total Leadership: Be a Better Leader, Have a Richer Life (Harvard Business, 2008), which has been translated into six languages. The program it describes is his challenging Wharton course, in which participants complete an intensive series of real-world exercises designed to increase their leadership capacity and performance in all parts of their lives by better integrating them, while working in high-involvement peer-to-peer coaching relationships and completing much of the activity online in a cutting-edge social learning environment. Total Leadership is used by individuals and companies worldwide, including as a primary intervention in a multi-year study funded by the National Institutes of Health on improving the careers and lives of women in medicine and by 57,000+ students in Stew\u2019s highly-rated Coursera MOOC.In 2001 Stew concluded a two-year assignment as a senior executive at Ford Motor Company, where he was director of the Leadership Development Center (LDC), running a 50-person, $25 MM operation. In partnership with the CEO, he launched a corporate-wide portfolio of initiatives designed to transform Ford's culture; 2500+ managers per year participated. Near the end of his tenure at Ford, an independent research group (ICEDR) said the LDC was a \"global benchmark\" for leadership development programs.Stew worked for five years in the mental health field before earning his PhD in organizational psychology from the University of Michigan. He has published on work/life, leadership, and the dynamics of change, including the widely-cited Harvard Business Review articles, \u201cWork and life: the end of the zero-sum game\u201d (1998); \u201cBe a better leader, have a richer life\u201d (2008); and \"Work+Home+Community+Self (2014); and \u201cThe Happy Workaholic: a role model for employees\u201d (in Academy of Management Executive, 2003). In 2013 Wharton Digital Press published his landmark study of two generations of Wharton students, Baby Bust: New Choices for Men and Women in Work and Family. Work and Family \u2013 Allies or Enemies? (Oxford, 2000) was recognized by the Wall Street Journal as one of the field's best books. In Integrating Work and Life: The Wharton Resource Guide (Jossey-Bass, 1998) Stew edited the first collection of learning tools for building leadership skills for integrating work and life.Stew serves on a number of boards and has advised a wide range of companies and public sector organizations, including the U.S. Department of Labor, the United Nations, and two White House administrations. He gives keynote addresses and conducts workshops globally on leadership and the whole person, creating change, and strategic human resources issues.

My primary research focus is on judgment and decision making with special interest in decisions about fairness, trust, and cooperation, and how expectations affect behavior. A second research focus examines the nature and evolution of social norms, how to measure norms (consensus and compliance) and what strategies to adopt to foster social change. This research is more applied, and forms the core of the newly created Penn Social Norms Training and Consulting group. A third, earlier research focus has been the epistemic foundations of game theory and how changes in information affects rational choices and solutions. \u2022 In my most recent work, I have designed behavioral experiments aimed at testing several hypotheses based on the theory of social norms that I developed in my book, The Grammar of Society: the Nature and Dynamics of Social Norms (Cambridge University Press, 2006). The experimental results show that most subjects have a conditional preference for following pro-social norms. Manipulating their expectations causes major behavioral changes (i.e., from fair to unfair choices, from cooperation to defection, etc.). One of the conclusions we may draw is that there are no such things as stable dispositions or unconditional preferences (to be fair, reciprocate, cooperate, and so on). Another is that policymakers who want to induce pro-social behavior have to work on changing people's expectations about how other people behave in similar situations. These results have major consequences for our understanding of moral behavior and the construction of better normative theories, grounded on what people can in fact do. \u2022 The nature and dynamics of social norms studies how norms may emerge and become stable, why an established norm may suddenly be abandoned, how is it possible that inefficient or unpopular norms survive, and what motivates people to obey norms. In order to answer some of these questions, I have combined evolutionary and game-theoretic tools with models of decision making drawn from cognitive and social psychology. For example, I use my theory of context-dependent preferences to build more realistic evolutionary models of the emergence of pro-social norms of fairness and reciprocity. \u2022 My earlier (but never completely abandoned) research focus was the epistemic foundations of game theory. I recently wrote about belief-revision in games, and what kind of solutions our belief-revision model supports. In my past work I have analyzed the consequences of relaxing the 'common knowledge' assumption in several classes of games. My contributions include axiomatic models of players' theory of the game and the proof that -- in a large class of games -- a player's theory of the game is consistent only if the player's knowledge is limited. An important consequence of assuming bounded knowledge is that it allows for more intuitive solutions to familiar games such as the finitely repeated prisoner's dilemma or the chain-store paradox. I have also been interested in devising mechanical procedures (algorithms) that allow players to compute solutions for games of perfect and imperfect information. Devising such procedures is particularly important for Artificial Intelligence applications, since interacting software agents have to be programmed to play a variety of 'games'."}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/han-thomas-adriaenssen", "name": "Han Thomas Adriaenssen", "description": "I am an Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Groningen.

Ware Travelstead Professor of the History of Architecture and Technology and Director of Research at the GSD. He teaches courses in the history and theory of architecture and technology. Trained as an engineer, architect, and historian, Picon works on the history of architectural and urban technologies from the eighteenth century to the present. His French Architects and Engineers in the Age of Enlightenment (1988; English translation, 1992) is a synthetic study of the disciplinary \"deep structures\" of architecture, garden design, and engineering in the eighteenth century, and their transformations as new issues of territorial management and infrastructure-systems planning were confronted. Whereas Claude Perrault (1613-1688) ou la Curiosit\u00e9 d'un classique (1988) traces the origin of these changes at the end of the seventeenth century, L'Invention de l\u2019Ing\u00e9nieur Moderne, L'Ecole des Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es 1747-1851 (1992) envisages their full development from the mid-eighteenth century to the 1850s. Picon has also worked on the relations between society, technology and utopia.

Ferrell, in the National Review declared that The Story of American Freedom \"approaches brilliance.\" Of The Fiery Trial, Gordon Berg observed in Civil War Times, \"looking for flaws in an Eric Foner book is like looking for flaws in the Hope Diamond; it is a fool's errand.\"In a recent book review, Professor Steven Hahn of the University of Pennsylvania wrote of Eric Foner: \"Like his mentor Richard Hofstadter, he has had an enormous influence on how other historians, as well as a good cut of the general reading public, have come to think about American history. This is the result of his voluminous scholarship and of his decades as a teacher. Indeed, when one considers the chronological and topical range of Foner's many books and essays--not to mention those of his doctoral students--only Hofstadter, C. Vann Woodward, David Brion Davis, and, in an earlier era, Charles Beard (who was also at Columbia) would seem to be his genuine rivals in impact and accomplishment.\"More info: http://www.ericfoner.com/"}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/hans-de-bruijn", "name": "Hans de Bruijn", "description": "Prof dr Hans de Bruijn is Professor of Public Administration in the Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management at Delft University of Technology. His research focuses on governance issues at the intersection of politics, management and technology, such as decision-making about large-scale infrastructure projects, the privatisation and deregulation of utilities, safety and security, river management, regulation and inspection, managing professionals and various types of government policy relating to technology.Such issues are usually characterised by a high degree of complexity. Governance involves a network of interdependent actors who behave strategically and know how to play the game. The type of problems that arise in this context are often ambiguous in nature, and the relevant information is often contested. Unforeseen dynamics are also very common. Hans de Bruijn has written several books on these issues, including Management in Networks: On Multi-Actor Decision Making (Routledge: London 2008, with Ernst ten Heuvelhof) and Process Management: Why Project Management Fails in Complex Decision-Making Processes (Springer: Berlin 2010, with Ernst ten Heuvelhof and Roel in \u2019t Veld). He has also published on the management of professional organisations, including: Managing Professionals (Routledge: London 2010) and Managing Performance in the Public Sector (Routledge: London 2007, 2nd ed.).Actors who deal with governance issues need to possess a high tolerance for complexity in order to understand these issues and come up with appropriate governance arrangements. At the same time, however, public debate in this area is less about tolerance for complexity and more about sense and simplicity. It is essentially also a game involving words, images and arguments. Hans de Bruijn is fascinated by this game and has written a short book, Geert Wilders Speaks Out (London: Eleven 2011), on the frames used by this internationally renowned Dutch anti-immigration politician, who has dominated public debate in the Netherlands for several years. He has also published a book (in Dutch) on patterns in the game of framing and reframing, which will appear in a revised English edition in 2015.More info here."}, {"link": "https://www.mooc-list.com/instructor/javier-garz%C3%A1s", "name": "Javier Garz\u00e1s", "description": "Formaci\u00f3n Estudios postdoctorales e investigador invitado en la Universidad Carnegie Mellon (Pittsburgh, EE.UU) Doctor (Ph.D.) (cum laude por unanimidad) Ingeniero Superior en Inform\u00e1tica (premio extraordinario) por la UCLM.
